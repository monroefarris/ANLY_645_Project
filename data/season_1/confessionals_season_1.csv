Episode,Day,Speaker,Text
1,1,Rudy,"Paddling over, uh, we had two or three of those boxes in the water, dragging 'em behind the raft and that is dumb! I said “Let's get them boxes aboard. It'll will be a lot easier.” You know, “That's dead weight you got.”"
1,1,Kelly,"He was yelling at everybody “Let's lose the box! Cut it loose now!” He may be 72 years old and an ex-Navy SEAL, but that doesn't mean that this is his world. (laughs)"
1,1,Ramona,"I don't like being on the water all that much. So, I mean, the whole motion like this, (mimes raft motion) and we're rowing, and we have like 100 pounds of stuff on the raft, I just, I just started heaving. I'm used to being in a lab with my lab coat on, in the air-conditioning. But this is, like, outdoors, 24-7, and you're exerting energy, like, almost all of that time."
1,1,Dirk,"Rich, um, I appreciate what he's trying to do as far as bringing the team together and stuff, 'cause that's one thing that needs to happen. I think he's got some good skills in that area. And, unfortunately, people like that annoy me."
1,1,Richard,"I'm good to go survival wise. People wise, it'll be a little, a little more challenging. But I've got the million dollar check written already. I mean, I'm the winner. And it's that kind of cocky attitude that makes people really hate your guts. So that's the kind of thing, I've really got to keep, uh... under wraps. But, uh, it's just, how do I get there from here?"
1,2,Rudy,"The hardest part is hanging around with all these young kids. I don't even know what MTV means, you know. And I'm used to being in the military and one guy stands up, he gives an order and there's no back talk. You know, like yesterday, everybody's trying to run the show and if they'd let one person do it, we'd be much better off. But trying to keep 'em all shut up is hard. If they'd listen to me, they'd all have haircuts and everything else, you know. We'd be in formation in the morning and all that kind of stuff, but they're not going to do that. I gotta fit in, not them. You know, there's more of them than there is of me."
1,2,Sonja,"I've been thrashing around like I'm 35, instead of acting my age, but we have a doctor in our tribe − uh, Sean − and he did a wonderful job of bandaging me up. I think one of the problems with aging is the thinning of the skin, darn it, and so I think I'm maybe getting a little more banged up than some of the younger ones."
1,2,Richard,"Well, the fish traps were hanging from the boat that we were coming over here, and when we were tossed into the sea on the raft and we could take whatever we could get our hands on, we grabbed three or four fish traps and a bunch of rat traps, and so we stuck the rat traps out the first night and boom − we got a rat in each of them."
1,2,Ramona,"I didn't sleep at all. I mean, we, we closed our eyes. We kept hearing noises and, like, clicking sounds, and we're, like, okay. Um, what's his name... Uh, Joel woke up, a rat was, like, in his ear."
1,2,Joel,"I heard something squeaking in my ear. Every time a rat was trying to get on the raft, or get near us or get at something. I mean, everything was moving."
1,2,B.B.,"What we're... we're just going along the beach here and just identifying whatever we can use for the shelter, the roof. And I'm a little irritated that none of the others are down here to help carry stuff, but that's okay."
1,2,Joel,"B.B... He's a character, man. I don't think he likes me much."
1,2,B.B.,"We got a lot of lazy people if you want to know the truth. You can't do it all yourself. You know, I asked Colleen to straighten this out for me and here it is. It's the only thing she had to do today. You can't have lazy people."
1,2,Gretchen,"He had been out there, you know, all morning long and, um... you know, it was hot!"
1,2,B.B.,"And the fire started because I had bought a set of glasses with me. I was going do it and Gretchen said, “Why don't I do it? I know how to do it, too.” So, I said, “Great!” And she took my glasses and started the fire."
1,2,Susan,"If we get fire, it means we're going to have a hot meal in our stomach which is going to bring up team morale. That first hot meal might be rat soup, which I'm, like, looking forward to very much because there's nothing wrong with a rat. All a rat is, is a squirrel without a fuzzy tail."
1,2,Sean,"We made a lot of smoke but, uh, no fire. I think that it would have been nice if we had fire, but we're not going to catch fish unless we have fire to cook it and I think that if we had fire, we could have spent a lot of time sitting around the bonfire at night maybe singing songs. We have a ukulele, you know, and, uh, that didn't happen and I wish it did."
1,3,Rudy,"Before we got on the island here, I formed opinions about people, but I changed my mind just on a trip in. Rich, for one. I mean, this guy is... He's strong. He's smart. The guy surprises me. You know, he's fat, but he's... (chuckles) he's good."
1,3,Richard,"I like Rudy. I'm not bothered by his, uh, straightforwardness at all. I don't think it's even a problem. I, I like it that he's saying “Hey, do this,” or, “Hey, do that,” but people are thinking of that as very direct and arrogant. That's the word I'm hearing, and I'm thinking to myself “Well, they think he's arrogant? Oh my God, I'm out of here!”"
1,3,Kelly,"We got Tribal Council tonight. Unfortunately, we're going to have to vote somebody off. There's going to be a lot of tension and one of us is going to leave."
1,3,Richard,"Well, somebody's gone. So, it's time to think about who are they going to vote for? Why are they going to vote? I've narrowed it down to four. I'm one of them."
1,3,Sonja,"Well, it could mean a lot uh, either staying or being voted out. You know, last night's competition, I really feel responsible because I couldn't keep up and I was dragged totally off my feet. I do feel that that stumble probably cost us the Immunity Challenge and that's a big one."
1,3,Rudy,"Up until, uh, probably last night, I never gave it a second thought about who I was going to vote off or if I got voted off, but after last night, uh... I thought about it then, and I decided then."
1,3,Stacey,"I feel pretty secure, actually, about the vote tonight. Kelly and I get along real well and we've been talking about strategy, and, you know, who's not contributing as much, and who would be best to vote off, and I think we, we've come to a mutual decision and we've talked to Sue about it."
1,3,Susan,"Stacey came up to me, and it's, like, she don't like Rudy and she's, like, “Oh, I think we're going to vote for Rudy, and vote him off 'cause he's still barking.” Well, anybody's too barking and too bossy to Stacey because she doesn't move her ass. The chicks think I'm voting for one person, and I'm not."
2,4,Stacey,"I'm hungry. I think we're all pretty hungry. I've gone days when I've only had some fruit, but... there's no prospect of having any food here. (laughs) It's worse. We got two rats, primed and ready to be cooked. It's dire."
2,4,Rudy,"These guys were talking about eating a rat. And when I get hungry enough, I'll eat one, but not now. I'm not close to it yet."
2,4,Sean,"I'd like to catch something and eat something of our own, and not have it be a rat. I'd like that a lot."
2,4,Kelly,"Fishing, um... I think we've been doing, you know, what, what we're supposed to do. We've... We've collected hermit crabs. We've put them in the traps. We rafted 'em out. You know, if we can just catch the one fish, then we can use that as bait and we'll catch more."
2,4,Richard,"We're getting there. We're getting to know each other a little bit more. I really wanna learn a little bit more about Stacey. Because, you know, I voted her off. She thinks it was Rudy. She even came up to me and said, uh, “Yeah, I think Rudy voted me off, but that's okay 'cause he's next anyway.”"
2,4,Stacey,"I think after the vote at the Island Council Rudy realized that he was just sort of a liability to us. He was sitting around barking orders and not really helping out much. We've all seen him eating extra food and doing inappropriate things in the kitchen. Like, he's leaving the knives out, they're getting rusty, and he's opening canned goods and fruit without asking anybody. I mean, we don't have a lot of food here, so I spoke up. Actually, Kelly, Sue and I decided that somebody needed to say something. And we put all the canned goods in one spot. We're all going to vote before we open something else."
2,4,Rudy,"Me and her wouldn't get along If we were friends on the outside... I'd definitely avoid her. She's too, uh, prim-like, you know. I mean, uh... after about three weeks out here in this jungle, she's gonna learn a lesson, I think."
2,4,Jenna,We're getting things done because B.B. is such a great worker. He gets us up. We're moving stuff this morning and everything. He's doing that.
2,4,Colleen,"I mean, really, B.B. He's adorable. I mean, who doesn't wanna own the B.B. action figure? He's great. He's amazing. He's got more stories than anybody I've ever met in my life. I think he's a little bit out of his element and he doesn't know how to... how to fix it without being a little bit aggressive."
2,4,B.B.,"The biggest workers are probably Gretchen, Craig and... I can't think of the lady's name in the pink swimming suit, but she, works her heart up."
2,4,Gretchen,"Work ethic is a big issue to B.B. Regardless of the wonderful personality or something, you know, it comes down to that with him."
2,4,Ramona,"You're working your butt off and he doesn't like to rest. He's like this workaholic. He just wants to get it done, get it done, get it done, and, yeah, that's great sometimes, but you can't push yourself like that and still, you know, maintain... I don't know. I just... I don't see it lasting too much longer. (07:00 → 07:15 = 15s)"
2,4,Ramona,"At this point, no one wants to have a confrontation with him, so, it's like, whatever B.B. says, it's like “Okay, B.B., yeah. Whatever you want!” And, I don't know, I guess, honestly, if we were to ever to lose an Immunity Challenge I think he'd probably be the first one voted off."
2,4,Richard,"Rudy and I − it's an interesting dynamic because if he knew I were gay that would be probably really difficult for him, I think. Seventy two years old, Navy vet. I think it would just freak him. But, he doesn't, as far as I know, know that, and I think he feels comfortable talking to me. I'm certainly comfortable talking to him. He's an interesting character."
2,4,Richard,"As people get to know me, they learn who I am and then eventually, over time, find out I'm gay. I've never once in my life encountered prejudice based on my being homosexual."
2,4,Rudy,"I was big-mouthing the whole time coming over here about being with homosexuals and lesbians. So I found out last night, you know. When he came up here he said, uh, “You want to talk?” I says, “No, I don't want to talk.” And he was going to tell me he was queer then. The homosexual, he's one of the nicest guys I ever met and he's good at what he does, you know. He's got leadership ability, and if these people here would listen to him, he would take them a long way. But anyway, uh, me and Richard got to be pretty good friends... not in a homosexual way, that's for sure. He's a pretty good guy. I don't know what my buddies are going to say when I get home but, uh, I'll have to deal with that."
2,4,Ramona,"I'm very, very finicky and as hungry as I am, if I really... if I eat that I'm going to throw it up. And I'd rather them eat it and be able to swallow it and digest it than me waste it, so... I mean, I'll just drink water, try to compensate."
2,4,Gervase,"Ramona's hurting big-time. You know, I feel bad for her, 'cause she wants so hard to, you know, get into the mix of things and help out and do her job, do her part, but she's just not feeling well."
2,4,Gretchen,"I don't think this is what she expected. I don't think she'd ever quit. I think she doesn't even want to admit that she's laying down a lot, but, um, I think it's only because she doesn't want to say that she can't be successful or something, 'cause I think she... I think at home she's very successful at what she does."
2,4,B.B.,"Well... I think the work ethic problem is − doesn't ever change. I mean, the people who work are working, and the people who rest are resting and that's... that's the way it is about 80, 85% of the time. The laziest person is Ramona. I mean, she just doesn't contribute anything. She probably hasn't worked 10 or 15 minutes in 5 Days. I mean, she's really a drag because she drinks our water, takes our... eats our food and takes room in the hutch."
2,4,Gervase,"He's such a hard worker. If you're not working as hard as him you're not working hard. I think it's just that simple. I feel everybody's been pulling their weight here. Nobody's been slacking. I mean, people have been sick. People have been hurting and I don't expect them to work."
2,4,Greg,B.B.'s a good guy. He's pretty strong-willed and he's got his plan as well. He's caring. He demands respect. Definitely feels the difference between his age and other people and doesn't seem to want to bridge that gap as much as just be who he is.
2,4,B.B.,"I think they find me, probably, abrasive, authoritarian. There's probably a couple other adjectives you could throw in there that probably work, too. I don't care. I'm not trying to win a personality contest. I just want to make my life here as comfortable as possible and then get the hell off."
2,5,Ramona,"Well, the whole Colleen-and-Greg thing − I don't know what's going on, what's not going on, but I kind of noticed like a couple of times they went off for fruit or whatever."
2,5,Greg,Colleen and I share a similar way of looking at everything that's happening.
2,5,Colleen,"Greg is great. It's just good to have a friend, you know. Sometimes, when you come to a country − a foreign country − a lot of times you're really nervous about all the mysteries that are there. You know, you hear about malaria. You hear about this, you hear about that. Like him, like walking around barefoot and picking up things and whatever, you feel a lot more comfortable, and the place becomes more your home."
2,5,Greg,"She's really fun to play with because she's fun, energetic. She's uh, rough and ready."
2,5,Colleen,"It's just, like, I'm actually making a friend out here, which I didn't think was really possible."
2,5,Ramona,"Greg and Colleen − they had disappeared again. And we were like, “Where are they?” I mean, they were gone for, like, an hour. You know, they come back and we had no idea where they'd gone, what they'd done, until that night, you know, they were like “Okay, we're going to have game night.” And we played the “All-New Newly Stranded Survivor Game.” (14:30 → 14:44 = 14s)"
2,5,Ramona,"Basically, it was kind of like a newlywed game. Team one was Gretchen and B.B. Team two was myself, Jenna and Gervase, and then, the third team was Colleen and Joel."
2,5,Ramona,"And so, of course, Greg was the host and he's just so wacky. I love this guy. Like, no matter what, he will have you laughing at least, like, five times a day. That is such a relief to have somebody there that's, like, the icebreaker."
2,6,Gretchen,"When we first got here, we started arguing, B.B. and I, about where to put the shelter and I thought it should be up in the canopy, you know, out of the sun and with some protection, and he thought it should be down on the beach. This morning we woke up and we saw that the moon was not yet full and high tide came almost to our doorstep. (16:27 → 16:40 = 13s)"
2,6,Gretchen,"We started bringing logs down and keep the waves from breaking on the hut 'cause it's going to wash away the support posts, and so he admitted that maybe I was right about putting it back further, he said but he still doesn't want it up in the canopy. Said he never will sleep up there, so..."
2,6,Joel,"You know, if the sky was blue and I said it was blue he'd say it was red just to disagree. I can't let it bring me down anymore."
2,6,B.B.,"He makes all of these great promises and, and, and of what he's going to do, like catch fish and everything else. He has not performed one thing he said he'd do. He reminds me of a guy that when you buy him for what he's worth and sell him for what he thinks he's worth, you make a million dollars."
2,6,Greg,"Well, I think they knock heads. B.B.'s very strong-willed and Joel is as well. They don't back down from one another and that causes a bit of friction − a bit of chafing if you want to put it in island terms."
2,6,Sean,"I'm definitely catching a fish today. Sea bass or salmon or whatever the hell we can get out of this ocean. Fish is a priority right now. Fish is very much a priority. Now that we have the fire, we need something to cook in it."
2,6,Susan,Sean sits there for five hours and builds a “Super Pole” and doesn't catch anything with it.
2,6,Sean,"Been fishing all day today and still nothing. I don't even get a nibble. So that's, you know, really dissatisfying."
2,6,Susan,"I told him it was a waste of time. (mockingly) “Oh, no, it's not a waste of time!” “Well did you catch any fish?” “No!”"
2,6,Richard,"He's, um, really wanting to get fish. Hadn't been able to bring any in, and I think that was really starting to eat at him."
2,6,Sean,Maybe the area is overfished or something. We'll figure it out sooner or later.
2,6,Joel,"When we get back, we're going to make some rice, we're happy. First thing he does is he washes his T-shirt in the kettle we're going to cook the rice in."
2,6,Gretchen,Every canteen was empty and the sun's going down and it's starting to rain. When are we going to get water? You know.
2,6,Gervase,"If B.B. thinks anybody on our tribe is slacking, he's... the heat is affecting him. Everybody on our tribe is working hard. And, I mean, everybody has different jobs. Building the shelter is probably the hardest job. He took that challenge on so somebody going out there trying to catch some fish might not look that important, but it's just as important."
2,6,B.B.,"I'm not voting when I wash my clothes. No one's going to tell me when I can do stuff like that. First place, this is not a democracy. I'll vote on things that don't matter, but things that matter, uh, and my survival... or, and... my comfort, I'm not going to vote."
2,6,Gervase,"Hmm, sounds tasty!"
2,6,B.B.,"I'm not going to quit, but if I can engineer an escape route for myself and do it right, do it ethically and do it correctly, then, sure, I'll do it."
2,6,Ramona,"I don't agree with that... with quitting. Just as, or engineering something just to save face."
2,6,Gervase,"I think he's trying to save face before getting voted off because I don't think he would have come here if that was the case. Now what's the point of coming all this way, going through all the crap we had to go through to get here, for you to all of a sudden decide that you wanna get voted off?"
2,6,Sean,"Stacey thinks she can do anything just like I do, and she's really did her own. I think what really pulled her through was eating those two bugs in lighting speed, because I think she impressed a lot of people, pulled her own weight. I think that's when she finally got accepted amongst the girls."
2,6,Ramona,"Tribal Council − it's kind of like... judgment day on Earth, kind of, and that's, that's like so daunting You're like, “Whoa!” I mean, you have to stand in judgment of your maker, and in this case, of, like, your fellow tribe members. My length of stay on the island depends on either what, like, somebody thinks of me or what they don't think of me or of my abilities. I'm not exactly a control freak, but I kind of like to be in control of things, and I have no control on whether I stay or go."
2,6,Jenna,"My vote would be I would vote Ramona off because B.B. is such a great wor... gets us up. He... We're moving stuff this morning and everything. I mean, we're getting things done because B.B. is there, too. He's doing that. As soon as we had breakfast, Ramona was back in bed."
2,6,Gervase,"I think it's, uh, likely B.B. will be the first one voted off. I think he pretty much... he dug his own grave. Now he's saying he wants to go. So, if that's what he wants, that's fine."
2,6,B.B.,"The first two people that I would consider voting out of here, beside myself, would be, uh... Joel and, uh... Ramona."
2,6,Gretchen,"Even though know we've only known each other for such short time I think we've bonded already. I think that's how everybody was feeling. Some people, you know, showed it and some people didn't."
2,6,B.B.,"They got to think long and hard before they vote me out, well because I think I contribute a lot. If Gretchen and I would leave this tribe, that'd be like dropping an atomic bomb here."
3,7,Sean,"Fishing is horrible. That saying, “There's a lot of fish in the sea.” Not this sea. They apparently didn't grow up in Pulau Tiga uh, because there is nothing to be caught out there."
3,7,Susan,"As far as the food holding up, uh, I don't... I think we're into Day 7. I lost track, but I know it's starting to whittle down. And I know we got to get fish in here then."
3,7,Kelly,"This is frustrating. I mean, it's the ocean! You think you'd get a fish somehow, but no luck so far. We all thought, “Oh, yeah, you know, we got these traps, we got hooks, we got a raft.” You know, there's no reason why we shouldn't be having big, fat fish for dinner every night, but we're just not. To me, that's kind of like “Oh yeah, woo-hoo, big survivors!” You know?"
3,7,Stacey,I think we've all sort of come to the conclusion that Rudy really needs to get out of here. He just criticizes whatever we're doing. He's hurting morale.
3,7,Kelly,"I think we were all kind of stoked that, you know, yeah, he's an ex-Navy SEAL, we're going to kick ass. But he really hasn't contributed very much. I think is definitely going to influence me the next time I go to Tribal Council. I think it's influencing all of us, you know."
3,7,Susan,"I have conflicts − personality conflicts every day with people. I deal with them, I work with them, I live with them, I go on. I'm gonna do the same thing here: I'm gonna get rid of the weakest member and vote Stacey out. And Stacey's trying to buddy up with everybody because she knows she's the weakest."
3,7,Stacey,"When Kelly, and Sue and I were on the raft we talked about who we'd vote off. Sue initially didn't want to talk about it, which immediately clued me in that she was planning to vote me off, even though we decided to stick together. So now I don't trust her as far as I can throw her, which, according to the group, would be not far."
3,7,Colleen,The oomph is a little gone from our group. I don't know why that is. I think that not eating is a factor of our mood.
3,7,Jenna,"We want food. (chuckles) Gretchen, Colleen and Greg, they were out looking for tapioca so that we could have mashed-potato style tapioca root."
3,7,Gretchen,"Operation: Tapioca has everything to do with finding tapioca, but we find other things on the way, too. (laughs)"
3,7,Colleen,The first time I came upon the mud volcano was with Gretchen and Greg.
3,7,Gretchen,We stopped at the mud volcanoes for a dip. We had a good time.
3,7,Colleen,"We walked out of the woods like, you know, Lord of the Flies, and, uh, I think the others were quite interested in our discovery so we took a group field trip."
3,7,Gervase,"It was a great feeling. It's just like a nice little celebration for everybody. You get together, just get dirty, and have a little fun − have a couple of laughs."
3,7,Jenna,"But it's also just to get away from the daily grind here. I mean, we're going to be here 39 Days. You got to keep yourself happy."
3,7,Rudy,I seen Dirk reading his Bible today. I didn't know he brought a Bible.
3,7,Dirk,"I just need that quiet time, and especially a lot of that quiet time includes just praying and meditating and praising God. That's kind of where I feel like all my strength and energy comes from. My testimony is not something I'm afraid to share, and that's just part of getting to know people and at a deeper and deeper level."
3,7,Susan,"I can only take so much preaching. I went to church. I put my time in. I believe in God and all that, but to constantly everything always come back on to “Jesus, Jesus”... yeah, Dirk's about driving me wild with that."
3,7,Stacey,I think Dirk has a little crush on Kelly. He doesn't have a chance in hell.
3,7,Kelly,"Stacey came up to me, ''“Yeah, I think he likes you.”'' you know. I was just, like, ''“Oh great!”'' you know? I didn't come out here for that, you know? I don't need, we don't need that."
3,7,Dirk,"Kelly's got a serious boyfriend, and unless she tells me otherwise, that's a line I'm not going to cross."
3,7,Kelly,I think he's really sexually frustrated. (10:19 → 10:34 = 15s)
3,7,Kelly,"I'm obviously not a virgin, but if he, uh... that's how he wants to live his life, that's cool. You don't meet too many 23-year-old guys who are virgins."
3,7,Richard,"He's interesting, being a virgin, 23, and not, uh, thinking about crossing that line 'til marriage. Ooh! He's extraordinarily religious, and I don't know that we'd ever be, you know, real close as a result of that because we're on such different ends of the spectrum religiously."
3,7,Dirk,"Rich, you know... homosexual people tend to talk about their homosexuality all the time, and it's really annoying to me. (11:03 → 11:12 = 9s) Maybe that's just me, but if he could cut that out, it'd almost be perfect around camp."
3,7,Gervase,"The thing is this: everybody knew coming in water wasn't my thing − swimming wasn't my thing, and my team knew it from the beginning, and so when we get into any kind of swimming situation, if it's actual swimming, we're gonna be struggling. You know, they have to compensate for me. But that's what a team does."
3,8,Richard,"Yesterday's competition was great. That was the, uh, pulling the treasure up from the water, dragging it in and getting the mask and snorkel. Oh, baby, that made me feel good. I wanted that mask and snorkel from Day 1... to go get, uh, fish."
3,8,Sean,"Rich, he overestimates himself sometimes, and we were kind of thinking that he wasn't going to catch anything. When you snorkel down there, there's nothing you can stab at. We have a good pole. I have my “Superpole”. Uh, which is, you know, it works-- in a Gilligan's Island sort of sense. We got some maggots, we got the “Superpole 2000” and we got the persistence of Dirk and me. We can't lose."
3,8,Richard,"This is a pretty good moment for me, 'cause I knew people were thinking I was just full of caca. It was just... you know, one of those things that I've been talking about fishing, talking about what I've been doing all my life... (20:28 → 20:41 = 13s)"
3,8,Richard,I actually think Sean was kind of sad that I beat him.
3,8,Richard,"Sean said, “Get something that looks like a fish.”"
3,8,Richard,"Finally, when I came up with a third one they said, “Good job, good job!”"
3,8,Sean,"He pulled through. He showed his true colors. He does know how to spear fish. He got us a couple of, uh, manta rays or whatever the hell they were."
3,8,Richard,"My position with the tribe-- it's probably gonna increase as a result of this. I talk about the things that I'm capable of doing and this might give them that “Oh, maybe some of what he's saying is true.”"
3,9,Colleen,We heard the rumor that the other team caught a fish with their spear.
3,9,Joel,"The mask-- that was definitely the key, uh, to them starting to get fish. And that does worry me a little bit 'cause they're going to be eating some protein."
3,9,Gervase,"I would definitely rather have fish than a rat, but... now it doesn't matter-- either or now."
3,9,Jenna,"Ho, I'm so ready to eat rat! I want to gut 'em, bone 'em, and then we'll have, like, some little rat meat in with the rice that we're eating. That would be delicious."
3,9,Greg,I'm not sure exactly what a rat might taste like. Nobody's said anything to me about what it could taste like.
3,9,Gervase,"Anytime anybody can hit one over the head, we're hitting them over the head, too. Gretchen hit one over the head the other night-- last night with the soup spoon."
3,9,Greg,The principle of the trap: This noose is wrapped around the inside of this area here. The bait's in there and is getting tugged out by the rat... (releases trap mechanism) and the noose goes tight.
3,9,Greg,Rats aren't bad. Rats are rats! Questions of edibility only have to do with your perceptions.
3,9,Greg,"I'm concerned that it'll be a bit gamy. We won't have quite the gravy we're looking for, which would really be helpful. Uh, when cooking rats, I would imagine the sauce is of the utmost importance."
3,9,Gervase,"There's plenty of food on the island. You won't starve out here with all these rats, man. There's tons of them and they're everywhere, so... there's definitely stuff to eat out here. I think people would just rather eat some fish instead, that's all."
3,9,Richard,"Today's Immunity Challenge day so we're building a, uh... stretcher. Gotta be a strong one. We don't know for what, but, uh... obviously, it's a competition that's gonna determine who kicks somebody out tonight."
3,9,Susan,"It's important to keep winning these games because for one, you win the immunity. You don't have to go through the brain rush of worrying about kicking somebody off the team."
3,9,Stacey,"In general, we're a really tight group. We all have our individual strengths and we're pulling together. It's just, if we could get Rudy out of here I think we'd be even stronger."
3,9,Colleen,"Right now, I am collecting stuff to build a, um... stretcher."
3,9,Gretchen,"For what, we don't know-- to carry our lightest member and whatever else, and through something or over something. I don't know."
3,9,Joel,"We have some idea, you know. It's going to involve a stretcher and an evacuation or something-- an emergency-type thing."
3,9,Jenna,"We're feeling a little bit defensive, but we're also feeling like we can do it. We can beat them 'cause you got a really light person and a really strong team pulling her."
3,9,Stacey,"Since we lost the challenge today, we go back to the Council tonight. Fun, fun!"
3,9,Richard,"Well, having lost the challenge, we've got to vote somebody out again. That's what happens every time we lose an Immunity Challenge."
3,9,Kelly,"I don't think it's gonna get any easier. You know, every time we go there, it's just gonna suck even more."
3,9,Stacey,"We haven't been in this Council in six days, and in those six days, we've all gotten to know each other pretty well, and I feel bad 'cause I know they're all, you know, as scared and… (sighs) about being, you know, voted off as I am. I thought it was a done deal that Rudy would be the next one off, but it could be me. I don't know."
3,9,Rudy,"It's either going to be me or Stacey, you know, that get voted off. I think the younger people are going to band together. They're going to get rid of me, and then they gotta cutthroat each other. I'm going to vote Stacey out at the Council tonight 'cause I don't like her (chuckles) and I'll never will."
3,9,Susan,I told Stacey I was going to vote for Rudy. But I was thinking about voting for her 'cause she was the weakest. I gotta think of the team; that's what I come here for.
3,9,Richard,"I've kind of prioritized people based on who's contributing, I think, and can contribute most to the competitions. I even wanted to talk with the group about who we were voting for and let's, you know, before we even go, know, so we could talk with the people, but... boy, did that not fly!"
3,9,Kelly,"I don't think anybody's out here to make friends. I'm not out here to make friends. People that you're forming alliances with now, and the people that you're getting along with now are people that are going to have to turn around and vote you, but somebody's gotta go. So, it's just the way it goes."
4,10,Colleen,I'm not a happy camper.
4,10,Gervase,"It was cold, man. It got cold and rained a lot, and everybody got, I mean... everybody was just wet."
4,10,Ramona,"It was long, wet and cold. It was the worst night I've ever slept."
4,10,Greg,"And worst trouble was the bugs-- the bugs love it. Once that rain comes, it's sand flea heaven."
4,10,Gretchen,"I have spent six years at the Air Force Survival School. You know, we learned how to make fires and shelters. When we got here, we argued over where the shelter should be, and everything I've always been taught, you know, you put it off the beach, you get canopy cover, which is your first layer of protection, but we made this huge shelter, which was not comfortable and it's not practical. It's a rain forest, so it was going to pour one of these times, and it poured, and we got soaking wet, and I just thought, “This is ridiculous” you know. And also, the gear is everywhere."
4,10,Gretchen,"I think I am a little frustrated with Joel today because Joel wants to take over, and that's fine, but Joel doesn't know about... where we're going to be the most comfortable, and so, you know, after last night, I thought, “Well, I just can't let this go on anymore.”"
4,10,Gretchen,"If this were, right now, each man for himself, Greg would be the victor. He's relaxed. He's not fighting this. It's not like a battle for him."
4,10,Joel,"Greg's a character, man."
4,10,Colleen,Greg talks into a coconut and thinks it's a phone.
4,10,Greg,"The nature phone is really a way that I kind of keep in touch with the greater, um... the greater spirit out here. You get reception everywhere. You're always incommunicado with everything and anyone, and, uh... you know, it's light, it's quick, it's easy, and it's relatively inexpensive."
4,10,Gretchen,"Greg knows what he's doing-- he kind of manipulates the group, and I think a lot of people don't even realize it's going on. I think most of the people don't even realize it's going on, but in his own way, Greg's the leader."
4,10,Sean,"Sue, she just always keeps working, working, working. You know, it just drives everybody crazy. I mean, the guys were talking about that today. I wish she would slow down for a little bit and just relax."
4,10,Susan,"We're getting by on coconut and rice. You know, whatever we can gather, and we're still not done looking for tapioca or not tapioca. Got to find the tapioca."
4,10,Sean,"I had this vision, and, uh, I thought I'd build myself a bowling alley right about here. That's what I'm doing here, slaving away. (07:15 → 07:24 = 9s) What I think I might do is, I might take some of those coconuts over there-- that are lined up like that-- I might take that bamboo over there and make, like, a little shelf where you can have the extra balls hanging up out there."
4,10,Susan,"Sean's telling me ''“Looking for nuts is a waste of time.”'' But at least you know you can find a nut. Sean sits there for five hours and builds his bowling alley. He could've been all getting nuts or looking for tapioca during the day. I'm tired of feeding people that don't do anything. If we lose tomorrow, I'm voting Sean off."
4,10,Sean,My parents would be so proud!
4,10,Sean,"There's a little bit of conflict of ideas between everybody right now, uh, regarding our next event."
4,10,Richard,"There was conflict there between Dirk and Sue when she was trying to get going and Dirk was saying, “No” and she made fun of his swagger."
4,10,Dirk,"The ideas I didn't like were just some of the things that maybe were a little bit tasteless or... you know, and don't have much class, you know. I believe that class kind of shows itself, and things like... (Kelly talks in front of the group about condoms) I don't know if that has much class, you know. That's not very creative. That's just looking in a bathroom stall wall."
4,10,Richard,"An idea comes up and you can see on people's faces when Sean is negative about it, and then they'll just harp on it and make it... want it even more."
4,10,Sean,"I just wish people would, you know, see things my way, in terms of, I think that what they want is something really spectacular, and I think that we could work through the night and build something really spectacular that would ensure us getting that crate."
4,10,Richard,"What's happening in my head is, “Here's the conflict. Here comes the dynamics that suck. Here come the people that just shout and don't listen. Here comes the negativity, and here comes the crap.” (12:49 → 13:01 = 12s)"
4,10,Richard,"Well, I know what the resolution to the conflict that exists right now would be at home, but I'm actually planning something different from that that might benefit me, and it's a little sneaky. (laughs) I think I'm going to handle this by beginning to develop alliances with some folks to ensure that I move into the next round."
4,10,Jenna,"I don't think Ramona's pulling her weight. I think that she really thought she could handle this, and now she's finding that I don't think she... she can as much as she thought."
4,10,Ramona,"Yesterday was bad, bad night."
4,10,Greg,The only thing Ramona can be is herself.
4,10,Ramona,"I'm a mama's girl. Well, I'm mama's only child, so..."
4,10,Greg,She has great gifts to offer. Maybe she will be able to. Maybe she won't.
4,10,Ramona,"But I can't do any more than I can do, and I'm not gonna try and bust my ass and try and prove something."
4,10,Gervase,"Every chance she got, she was just making it worse. I tried to pull her to the side and just point certain things out to her and try to get her to correct that situation."
4,11,Dirk,I really like our slogan-- I think it's going to grab someone's attention. We're giving it our best shot. We want to win.
4,11,Gervase,"Work-wise, Ramona seemed today to be, “Oh, I'll help here, I'll help here. I'll do this, I'll do that.”"
4,11,Ramona,"I feel more like a part of the group, and I don't know if that's because I'm feeling better and therefore I'm working more and harder, or if it's because, like, I've started to assert myself. I don't know. I guess it's a combination."
4,11,Colleen,"I didn't like the final decision for the, for the S.O.S. game. I thought it was quite silly-- a smiley face? Give me a break!"
4,11,Gretchen,I didn't expect us to win anyway.
4,11,Ramona,"I'm down. I hate to lose. It sucks! But tomorrow's the one that counts, so... trying to look up."
4,11,Kelly,The whole idea of an alliance is to make sure we're all... voting the same way.
4,11,Richard,"So the, um... alliances have begun, and I didn't even have to do much about it."
4,11,Kelly,"Sue and I had discussed on our own about getting Richard in the same vote and us three having the same vote. Because the more people you know that are going to vote for somebody else, you might as well go with that. You might as well, you know, keep yourself safe, and, you know, keep it in the majority."
4,11,Susan,"We have alliances that are happening within the group, and you're going to have that, just because, you know, everybody's... “Hey, there's money involved.”"
4,11,Richard,We really could control our fate if we stick together.
4,11,Kelly,"We really like Rudy. Rudy's kind of crabby, but he's a lot better to get along with, you know, than the two boys. At least he's honest. You know, he'll tell you, you know, “Up yours!” in a second."
4,11,Rudy,"Somebody said that if you want to sort of gang up against somebody, you ought to talk about it to get rid of them, but uh, I don't agree with that, so I'm not doing it. I don't know about the rest of them."
4,11,Richard,"I think we can trust the three of our votes, 'cause if one of us blows up, trustworthiness-wise, then this whole thing's out the window and it's... it's a free-for-all."
4,11,Ramona,"Jenna-- she's like this Energizer bunny that, like, keeps going and going and going. Like, I haven't had a white friend since, like, Junior High School, and I really can see her being, like, my first white friend in a long time."
4,11,Gretchen,"I think Ramona's change has to do with she's feeling more comfortable, she's feeling better. She feels like she's more part of the group, which I don't think she felt in the very beginning."
4,11,Gervase,"I think we've definitely seen Ramona's redemption this week. Looks like she's turned things around. That's in my eyes, she's redeemed herself. Other people's eyes, it could be totally different."
4,11,Jenna,"I think Ramona has changed her attitude... well, no. Changed her work ethic a lot. But I don't think her attitude has changed much. She is working more, she's trying, but I think maybe it is a little too little too late."
4,11,Ramona,"This is what I'm like every day when I'm feeling like at a 100%. I'm feeling... good about being a part of the group. Hopefully, everyone sees, like, “Wow. This is Ramona!” you know, “This is what, like 100% Ramona can offer to the team!”"
4,12,Greg,"The Immunity Challenge will be huge today whether the other team loses and has to vote out another person, then they're two people short of what we have, or if we have to vote somebody out. Uh, things should get interesting."
4,12,Jenna,I don't wanna make that trek tonight. We gotta win.
4,12,Gervase,"We'll win. It might be close, but we'll definitely win today. Without a doubt."
4,12,Richard,We got to win this Immunity Challenge.
4,12,Susan,We got to stomp them so bad.
4,12,Dirk,"We're excited for the challenge, we feel confident, and we feel ready."
4,12,Joel,"Yeah, this is a big one, and this is huge. Um, you know, yeah, we don't want to lose this one."
4,12,Gervase,"We're here to compete, and we're here to win these competitions, and we're here to do them as a team."
4,12,Colleen,"I wouldn't say we're-we're cocky. I just think that we're, uh, we're the best."
4,12,Gervase,The most difficult thing of this whole thing for me is to vote somebody off. I think we're dreading that.
4,12,Jenna,"Going to this Island Council meeting tonight it's really tough. The thought of eliminating any of these people that we're placing all of our-our confidence in, it's getting worse. I can't imagine and I can't fathom voting off somebody from this team tonight."
4,12,Colleen,"I'm going, not knowing what's going to happen, and I'm nervous. I'm nervous about votes being against me tonight because of... I'm not a champion in the competition."
4,12,Jenna,"Speed-wise, we got right down there. We got right down to the treasure chest, and it just kept collapsing in, and it was so devastating. All day I had this feeling that my leg would be the one that would lose it for us, and it did. It does make me feel vulnerable, um, for the vote tonight."
4,12,Gervase,"If somebody had to go right now in our tribe, I would vote for Jenna, because she's more annoying than Colleen. I could deal with Jenna not being here, then just keep Colleen around a little longer."
4,12,Greg,"We're all friends, and then you boot someone. It's like the game board Sorry! You pick the card and you got to take your thing and smash the other guy out of the way. Knock 'em out, that's that, you move on. Sorry!"
5,13,Colleen,"We slept late for the first time since we've been here today. Everybody is a little bit on edge, everybody is a little vulnerable today."
5,13,Joel,"I think today we're just a little bit down because another person is gone, of course. And we can see that the group's getting a little bit smaller. Even if it's only two people smaller, it's still getting a little bit smaller and, uh, we're starting to see that a little bit."
5,13,Jenna,"For some reason, the last two to three days we've just been really down. I think its got a lot to do with just, uh, we lost two in a row. We lost a member of the group and one of... who I consider one of our male leaders, Greg, was really feeling terrible. He's got an ear infection He's really sick."
5,13,Gretchen,"I think the camp looks trashy. I think stuff's all over the place. I think the flag should be up. I mean, there's a lot we can do to make this camp look really nice. I mean, something's going to have to change. Something's going to have to happen to make everybody decide to pitch in."
5,13,Rudy,"That is the parachute that they dropped the cargo with the other day that, uh, contained some goodies and, uh, right now, they want to hang the parachute up for shade."
5,13,Kelly,"Me, personally, I was a little irritated with, um, Sean and Dirk's effort around camp. I mean, they try to go out fishing when they know they're not gonna catch anything and I think, personally, it's just so they can say, “Hey, well, we did something.”"
5,13,Sean,"Kelly thinks that failure to catch fish is failure to try. You know, I think she's equating those two, which is not true. (05:22 → 05:32 = 10s)"
5,13,Sean,"The fish are not biting hooks out here for some reason. Either we got the wrong bait, or we're going the wrong time."
5,13,Rudy,"Fishing with a hook, I think, is useless. They put about 25 hours in and not a bite. That's big enough hint for me not to go fishing with a hook."
5,13,Susan,"I'm just irritated with them. Sean and Dirk going out wasting three days in the daylight fishing. And I let them know, too."
5,13,Sean,"It's expected to get on each others nerves. Maybe everyone's on my nerves, too, but I just don't really act on it. I just wanted to be happy − have a nice life here and that's it."
5,13,Kelly,It's been the people who really work and contribute to camp versus people who are lazy and don't really do anything to contribute to the camp.
5,13,Dirk,"The second I stop having fun I'll vote myself off the island. I came here to have a great time, grow in my faith with the Lord and that's the most important thing to me."
5,13,Rudy,"It's funny to me that a guy would read the Bible out here. The only reason I'd bring a Bible is if... I mean, I'm religious too... if I needed toilet paper."
5,13,Sean,"We had a little visit from Jeff, our host, today, and he came by and told us that tomorrow's going to be a competition, a Reward Challenge. So we've been practicing all day at that. (08:16 → 08:26 = 10s)"
5,13,Sean,"Turns out that I'm pretty good with the blowgun. And I never really... never shot a blowgun before in my life. Turns out Rich is an expert marksman. Something we didn't know about him until today, so, uh... he has excellent aim when it comes to a slingshot. And Sue throws that spear much better than any of the guys in our tribe. She's a wild woman with the spear."
5,13,Susan,"And I was kind of hoping that I'd be good at nothing so that I could just, like, hang back and let the pressure go on somebody else. Turns out I throw the javelin the best. I'm thinking the other team's going to have a guy throwing the spear. So if there is, there's a good chance that I can dog some guy on national TV. Even if we lost and I at least dogged the guy in the spear throwing, they'd be happy."
5,14,Joel,"I never really threw a spear in my life. Except, you know... anything serious. It's kind of hard to keep it straight. That's a good distance, especially a little thing like this, and you don't know if you can take a running start or how you should do it, or what the thing is, so this looks like it's going to be our weakest event for sure. Because the other girls have the, uh, blowgun down really well. The slingshot looks good. So it'd be nice to win it today. You know a lot of these Reward Challenges we haven't really been after, but, uh, you know, I think we're all really determined for this one. Looks good."
5,14,Jenna,"I don't know what brought us down, but it seems like winning that challenge just brought everybody right back up. I can't speak for the rest of the tribe, but I really wanted to win 'cause it was fruit. I wanted to win that more than any of the other reward thus far. Unexpectedly, we came back with three live chickens which was absolutely wonderful. (16:11 → 16:26 = 15s)"
5,14,Jenna,"Well, we're going to see if they produce any eggs, but I'm really thinking that we're going to wait every other day and eat a chicken."
5,14,Gretchen,They're not going to be around long. Everybody's waiting for them to lay eggs but I think they're under a lot of stress and there's three of them in that box and so they have a very short time to produce before they're slaughtered.
5,14,Gervase,"The fruit and the chickens was just so huge to us, really, I mean... I think that's the biggest reward so far to date. (17:04 → 17:19 = 15s)"
5,14,Gervase,"I think we were down just because we lost. I mean, no matter how you look at it, losing hurts and we had to vote somebody off. So we just had to get out of that, and then, when we won the Reward Challenge, that was our momentum right there."
5,14,Susan,"As far as losing the challenge today, I was a little irritated. Here's my dream come true. I can stomp a guy on national television and I miss by two inches. It was a bummer, but then when they pulled the chickens out, I started laughing. Cutting off a chicken's head? No, it's not what I would want to do for food. I can live without the chicken right now."
5,14,Richard,"So that was all right. The other team won some live chickens with some eggs. So we came back here and I went spearfishing and got us a nice eel. That's the first eel. If I'd seen others, I'd have gotten others."
5,14,Kelly,"At least we eat stuff that we go out and catch and look for ourselves, and we don't have it handed to us."
5,14,Sean,"The eel was pretty horrible. Uh, it wasn't any good whatsoever."
5,14,Kelly,"We thought it was going to be you know, big, fat steaks of meat, but it really wasn't."
5,14,Rudy,I wouldn't go after eel again if I had a choice − I would have rather had chicken without a doubt.
5,14,Gretchen,My feelings on who the leader is has always been Greg. He's just really good at it.
5,14,Greg,"I may be slipping into some sort of leadership position. I'm attempting to avoid it. I don't want to be the leader of anything. I go play by myself, help out the tribe as much as I can and try and recharge my batteries so I can be there fully with them."
5,14,Gretchen,"He's really good at living in the woods, too. I think, out of everybody here, Greg's the most comfortable in the woods."
5,14,Greg,"My psychological comfort does not come from sleeping with the group in a hut. In fact, they kind of make me nervous, 'cause there are a lot of people doing a lot of different things and it's a lot of energy in a very small space while I'm trying to, uh, clear my head of energy. Sleeping in the forest is comfortable for me. I'm making a little sleeping pad. Sleeping pad, sleeping bag − depending on how big it gets. I just used some bedding of debris or whatever I can find − palm or the leaves that are around − and pile up a bunch of debris. It's all a nesting instinct. As with everything, make yourself a nest. I nest like a mama bird. Papa bird − more like a papa bird than a mama bird. A single... like a bachelor bird, I guess. Colleen has joined me in the forest to sleep. She apparently finds it more comfortable, as well."
5,14,Gervase,"I mean, they go off a lot, seems like together. Like last night, for example, while everybody was going to bed, they got out, and nobody saw them till just this morning sometime."
5,15,Jenna,I noticed they seem to be spending their nights out under the stars and cuddling up. I think it's stepped up a notch − maybe a little romance going on.
5,15,Colleen,"Um, when we go off, it's all about sex. It's all that's happening. Um... it's a really passionate affair right now. Things are going great. (laughs)"
5,15,Greg,"The question was asked before whether this was a romantic situation or not, and I will reaffirm that there is no romance."
5,15,Colleen,"You know, he reminds me of my friends back home, so it's like I can totally, totally be myself with him."
5,15,Greg,"So we like to play together − not as a romantic situation, but, yeah heading back out in the forest and sleeping out there and the rest of it is great."
5,15,Richard,"This is a yellow-banded sea krait. We find a number of them in the jungle. I haven't seen one down here on the beach. I'm hoping he goes for a swim. I might help him. He's awake now. Oh, I'm not afraid of snakes. I mean, I don't want to be bitten by something that's deadly, but, no, I used to play with garter snakes, when I was a kid and feed them frogs, and... You know, they're not… They are quick, and it's... and they are... they can move fast, but you can see when he's about to coil up and strike and you can prepare yourself and you can get ready to move before it does. I want to put him in the water 'cause I want to watch him swim. (23:14 → 23:24 = 10s)"
5,15,Richard,"We've been told they're extremely deadly − immediately deadly, within six hours deadly. Horseflies bother me more."
5,15,Sean,"I knew today was going to be a good day when I woke up. I haven't had a bowel movement in nearly two weeks. This morning, I had my first bowel movement − felt fantastic. I'm getting thinner and thinner. I think I'm using most of the rice I make 'cause I'm not bloated and my pants are getting skinnier. Very excited about it − it's the way to start the day off, with a little bit of a bowel movement. Nice work, Sean. Go, New York, go! (24:10 → 24:19 = 9s) We were concerned about Dirk and his eating a while ago, because he was really disappearing into nothing. We're all losing a little bit of weight, but Dirk was really losing a lot of weight."
5,15,Dirk,"I definitely lost a lot of mass, a lot of muscle mass, a lot of strength. It's not going to help me but, as long as I conserve my energy − don’t-don't waste it on things that we don't need − as long as I'm smart about it, I think I'll be okay."
5,15,Kelly,"We've noticed Dirk kind of getting a little skinny. Um, there was a few days where we were all kind of concerned about him and, uh, he was just kind of... I think, you know, mentally, he was-- he was a little bummed out and all of us were, like, you know, “Eat more rice, eat more rice.”"
5,15,Kelly,"Well, we all kind of try and keep an eye on him, 'cause he was real skinny to begin with, you know. The labor thing is... it's actually better now. Sean and Dirk started to realize that they better, you know, do something. Otherwise, they're out of here. (laughs)"
5,15,Susan,"They've kind of come around the last couple, two, three days and started doing a little more, but it's a little too late for that."
5,15,Dirk,"Maybe I am on thin ice with this team now. I don't know. I feel like I'm pulling my weight and I think the group sees that and I'm just going to find tapioca, and I'm just going to let it work itself out."
5,15,Sean,There was about five on this stem that I picked up but only one was good. The rest were mushy. So I had to throw the rest away.
5,15,Kelly,Today's Day 15 and we have an Immunity Challenge today.
5,15,Sean,"Hopefully, um, it'll be something that, uh... that we can win pretty handily, and I don't feel like going to the Immune Council tonight by any means. (28:27 → 28:39 = 12s)"
5,15,Sean,"Apparently, we need one rower and the rest of us swimming which is good, because we have Kelly who's a rower. That's what she does as a profession for a living."
5,15,Kelly,"I'm a commercial white-water raft guide, so obviously, I'm the rower today. Feeling a little pressure, but I'm not too worried about it. I know Gervase can't swim, so my guess is that they're going to put him in the boat rowing, which is cool for me because I can beat him any day of the week."
5,15,Jenna,"You can look at it as a disadvantage that, uh, Gervase can't swim. But we all are going to have our differences. Not all of us are going to be strong at everything."
5,15,Gervase,"Comfort level with swimming's about 80%. I mean, I've heard you're more buoyant in the ocean, because of the salt water. I don't know that, though. To me, I'll sink like I was in a pool."
5,15,Kelly,"Tonight we have to take the suckfest hike to the Tribal Council, and we get to vote somebody off tonight, unfortunately. You know, despite everything, I was the best choice to put in that boat today, and, you know, like I said, sometimes your best just isn't good enough and life just wouldn't be life if everybody didn't get their little embarrassments from time to time, so..."
5,15,Sean,"Oh yeah, it's always in the back of my mind whether or not anyone's going to vote against me, you know. I don't have a vote against me yet, and now we're losing numbers so I'm sure one's coming, just like the other people who don't have a vote against them, one's coming in their direction, too. I suspect it might be Rudy. That's how I'll probably cast my vote at this point."
5,15,Richard,"It's an interesting game, but it's a game, and I've had a strategy from Day 1. I've already built an alliance and we're going to work through as best we can right to the end before the free-for-all."
5,15,Dirk,"I think I'm vulnerable. I've tried my hardest and put as much effort if not more into everything, but I haven't been successful in any areas so maybe some people will look at that and say, “Dirk doesn't know what he's doing. He's being lazy.” Whatever. But I think they realize that I'm a valuable member of this team, so I'm not worried about being voted off. I think I'll be here tomorrow."
6,16,Susan,We're having a Pagong day. We're laying around doing nothing.
6,16,Richard,"This is an interesting point in the game right here-- right on the verge of the merge. Two nights before we merge, it's an interesting time. Change is coming, as they say."
6,16,Kelly,"I think it'll be cool when we merge. I think they're nice people. I don't think they're taking this... seriously. They're playing “Island 90210.” They think that they're gonna go to their little mud volcano and give each other facials and they don't need to really do anything because they're just here to... look cute on TV, I don't know."
6,16,Susan,"They better send them with some supplies, that's all I can say. There's three of them that we need out of here. Greg, definitely. He's just way too psychotic. The other one is speedball-- Jenna. She... yeah, she's going to grow old real fast on us. Gervase. He's a pervert. He's gone. And the chickens all better be dead because they'll be dead when they get here."
6,16,Joel,One hour to chicken time. T-minus one hour.
6,16,Gretchen,We're going to wait till about another hour and then we're going to chop their head off.
6,16,Joel,We'll take the little nasty one first.
6,16,Gretchen,And pull out all their feathers. I think not everybody wants to participate in the chopping of the head.
6,16,Colleen,"I can't-- I mean, come on, it's a little chicken."
6,16,Joel,There is not going to be a trace of that thing on Earth.
6,16,Gretchen,"I don't have any emotional attachment. From the moment I saw them, they were food. They, you know, they never were pets to me. I don't enjoy killing things. It's not, like, a thrill to kill something, but anybody who eats meat has to realize that somebody killed that. Someone's killing it for you."
6,16,Colleen,I don't want to watch it die. I want to have it put on my plate and put in front of me.
6,16,Gervase,"I'm missing food the most. I mean, I could go for some chicken right now. Any kind: baked, fried, I don't care-- food."
6,16,Colleen,"I just like to ignore that whole aspect of, uh, the food chain-- the whole death part."
6,16,Jenna,"Oh, we're going to eat, uh, three chickens in three days. We want to eat them before we merge tribes. We don't want them getting any of our chickens. Besides, one of them was pecking the hell out of me."
6,16,Colleen,"I've interacted with the chickens as little as possible. I'm not petting them, putting them on leashes, taking them for walks, naming them and, you know, calling them my very own. It does no good to befriend dinner."
6,16,Jenna,"I've never gone through the process of feeding a chicken, watering a chicken, then butchering a chicken. I can smell the, like, the grease and... And it's going to fry and it’s going to bubble and… (sighs)"
6,16,Gervase,Mmm! Dinner. Chicken!
6,16,Gretchen,"People were happy before, I know that the nutrition hit their bodies. It was, I think, the first really recognizable piece of protein that people have had that, you know, everybody kind of knew what it was and make you feel like you chewed on something. (08:16 → 08:25 = 9s) I think, mentally, the chicken was more important than it was physically."
6,16,Richard,"It's funny when I hear ""How come you're naked all the time?"" I'm naked less than one percent of the time. I'd like to be naked all the time. That would be smarter in this 100-degree weather."
6,16,Susan,(laughing)
6,16,Kelly,He walks around naked quite a bit. I think it probably bugs some of the guys.
6,16,Sean,Seems kind of childish and immature to me and kind of grandstanding and walking around on national TV.
6,16,Rudy,He runs around pretty often without clothes on and he don't think nothing of it.
6,16,Richard,I couldn't care less whether guys or girls are around. It doesn't make any difference.
6,16,Sean,"If there's any horny gay men out there that want a horny guy in return, I know one."
6,16,Richard,"Naked isn't sexual to me, and it doesn't... I don't think of it that way, it doesn't faze me that way so, no, I'm pretty comfortable naked."
6,16,Rudy,"I don't agree with his lifestyle and I told him that, and he probably don't agree with mine. But, anyway, we got to work together up until this merger, anyway. So I finally went along with this alliance and if I didn't, I'd be out of here probably the next vote or the one after."
6,16,Richard,"I've been trying to support keeping Rudy from Day 1. I want to bring him along to the next round where... he won't care much and probably will get voted off before, uh... winning. I don't think somebody's in control of our group, in particular. I think... I'm in control of... who's being voted off and I think that's all that matters to me."
6,16,Gervase,"I made a totally dumb statement now that I regret. You know, it was kind of just a poke at the girls, give them a little shot. ""Girls are the stupidest thing on the planet next to cows"" was the remark."
6,16,Gretchen,"Well, I said, ""You know, Gervase, I told those girls that all they had to do was, like, when they write your name on that piece of paper and hold it up to the camera they can look straight into the lens and go, 'Moo!'"" (laughs) His mouth dropped open like he had never considered that maybe that was not the best thing to say to a woman who had that much power over him."
6,16,Gervase,"No, I'm being very apologetic because it was stupid. I mean... a-after I said it, you know, I could... after I said it… (gets interrupted by Colleen)"
6,16,Colleen,"Gervase is... He's on a free ride, man. He's untouchable. I don't know how he gets through. He’s called the women cows. He doesn't do stuff half the time."
6,16,Gervase,"I haven't done a thing out here since I've been here, it seems like, and that's cool. Joel does the fishing. He does the paddling. I'm just out there hanging on the raft with him. When they built that hut on the beach, I was nowhere near there. I was in the shade somewhere. You know, I was looking for a coconut or something. I think everybody has done cooking rice at one point in time. I have yet to cook anything."
6,16,Jenna,"I didn't see him do anything yesterday, but that is nothing new, and that surprises me that I still haven't voted for Gervase. He doesn't seem to pull his own weight, and I know for a fact that he voted against me, so why the hell haven't I voted for him? I don't know."
6,16,Gervase,I knew coming here was all about charm and personality. That will get me through.
6,16,Colleen,"His charm does get him through, you know, but he hasn't been so charming today, so maybe he's going to get the vote."
6,17,Gervase,"It could be some natural thing from the island, man. Larvae in tomato sauce."
6,17,Greg,"I choose my preservatives and chemicals wisely, and that really would have thrown everything off-balance."
6,17,Joel,"Your standards definitely, definitely take a dive when you come into a situation like this. When you get hungry, you'll eat anything."
6,18,Gervase,"We need to stick together, really, as Pagong, still, and just wipe them out. Just pick them off one by one."
6,18,Joel,"Colleen-- she said that she does not want to vote anybody on our team off until all of their team is gone. We want to stick together. Jenna also has said that she is not going to vote anybody on our team off. Greg said openly that he's not going to vote anybody on the team off. Gervase has said it openly. I've said it numerous times openly. I've never heard Gretchen say ""I want to keep this team together."""
6,18,Gretchen,"I don't see myself joining a voting alliance, but if it's somebody that I'm thinking of voting off, that would be great. I'll vote along with everybody else."
6,18,Joel,"If we win, and we go in with an advantage, we just all got to stick together, stay as a team like we've been doing all the while."
6,18,Colleen,"Joel seems to be ignoring the fact that we have one more Immunity Challenge before we combine the tribes, and if we lose it, somebody's being voted off, and he talked way too much about what he's going to do when the tribes are combined, the strategy, the combination-- da-da-da. What if he doesn't make it to the combining of the tribes?"
6,18,Gretchen,"I know that ladies' man has irritated every woman in this tribe, so..."
6,18,Joel,I'm not a chauvinist. I believe that a woman can do anything a man can do.
6,18,Jenna,Joel thinks he's the all-American and all of these physical challenges are just feeding his ego.
6,18,Joel,"Go ahead. If you want to compete with me, I'm fine with it. I haven't wrecked anything, I haven't broken anything, I haven't lost any competitions."
6,18,Colleen,"You know, he's Golden Boy. He's Mr. January-- he's going to have a calendar. He's Captain America, really."
6,18,Joel,I can't really think of anything that I've done that's bad.
6,18,Jenna,"Towards us ladies, he seems to, uh, be pretty condescending like, he has to explain everything so thoroughly that we just couldn't understand it without Joel. I don't see why he feels the need to treat us like we're children."
6,18,Colleen,"He is full of, ""Don't do this,"" ""Put it here,"" ""do that,"" ""Watch out,"" da-da-da. Well, then, get up and do it."
6,18,Gretchen,"You can't be a woman who's strong enough to volunteer to come here and take what comes... and then overlook a comment like he doesn't trust you to cook the rice. A woman just is not capable of doing the things as good as… as he is. And it took us a while to even bring it up to each other, but once we did, it's, like, ""Oh, you feel that way, too?"" And I know that, you know, all three of us are feeling that."
6,18,Joel,"I'm totally square with everything across the board-- whatever anybody thinks-- um, but, no, I definitely am not a chauvinist. (rolls eyes)"
6,18,Rudy,"I was surprised when I seen the two Special Forces guys come down the beach. At first, I thought they were British Marines, but, uh, they were American."
6,18,Rudy,"I can do the obstacle course, but not as fast as I used to and, uh, it's only going to be... The winner's going to be as fast as your slowest person, so, uh, maybe I can beat one of the girls."
6,18,Gervase,"We're all going to be excited, hyped up. I want them to challenge us and push us, you know, make us work hard for this victory, 'cause, I mean... we're coming full steam ahead at them."
6,18,Richard,We're thinking we can do this.
6,18,Joel,"The thing is, we're coming back after the challenge, you know-- I'm sore, you know-- we lost. Tired, beat up-- coming back here thinking, ""All right, we're going to have some chicken."" Um... coming up the trail and what do I see? I come around the box... and that little one was still there. Had his head stuck in the side of the box. Just pulling. And I yelled and he took off. The monitor got the biggest meal of the day. I mean, that monitor ate twice as much at one meal than I've eaten since I've been on this island, man. Totally ate my chicken."
6,18,Gretchen,"You boil it long enough, you can eat anything, and it's already been tenderized... and gutted and decapitated, so half the work is done."
6,18,Gretchen,The Tribal Council is a necessary part of the game. But it's the nasty part of the game. It's the part that I enjoy the least and that I could do without. I don't know who's going to go. Could be anybody.
6,18,Joel,I've seen how Jenna acted the last couple times when she voted against somebody. She really didn't want to look at them or talk to them-- she showed guilt and she hasn't... she's really been avoiding me the last couple days.
6,18,Jenna,"I know who my vote is, and it... it would be Joel. But, uh, I can’t speak for the rest of the tribe. I got a vote last time, so maybe I'll be off."
6,18,Colleen,"Gervase-- he's just as chauvinistic as Joel is, God! He just hides it better. I want to vote for him at the next Tribal Council because he voted for me, and I'm starting to just have, like these little conflicts with him."
7,19,Richard,"Our camp's way better than theirs just from talking to them. They don't have a living room with benches, never mind a decent kitchen. I think our house is better from what they've described. We have fish."
7,19,Susan,"As far as somebody coming here from Pagong today, it's going to be fun. We like having company over at camp, even though we don't have a whole lot to offer for lunch. I'm hoping... I think the kicker of it all will be if Rich gets fish and we have fish for lunch. I think they'll be here."
7,19,Gretchen,"I'm excited about it being a big group, because right now there's not a lot of personalities going on and it's quiet and we've seen every inch of this little place here, and I'm excited to meet new people, and even if it's some good, some bad, or whatever, at least, it's something. It's a mix and so it'll be more interesting than it is right now."
7,19,Richard,"Yeah, when we merge tonight, I think it'll be interesting. I think, uh, it'll set up a whole 'nother set of interpersonal dynamics that'll be fun for me to watch."
7,19,Susan,"The alliance that we have going on is Rich, Rudy, Kelly and me. We'll vote four people strong, and if we can make it through the first two votes, getting somebody off of their team off... (chuckles) we should be able to slide into home plate."
7,19,Rudy,"Six days ago, I was 180 out, but, uh, I seen the light. It's… (chuckles) If you want to win this money, you got to get a little dirty."
7,19,Susan,The reason Sean's not in the alliance because... Sean... is dumb.
7,19,Richard,"Sean's ethically against any kind of alliance and I hear Gretchen is similar on the other side and, um... I don't get it. You know, I-I consider myself extraordinarily ethical and moral and, uh, this has absolutely nothing to do with this. I... it sounds like sheer stupidity to me when somebody says ""Oh, no, I'm not going to build an alliance, and I hope they wouldn't do that either."" Uh, you know, I giggle and think, ""okay."" (laughing)"
7,19,Gervase,"Sean's cool. Sean's a nice guy. He had a lot of stories to tell, and... I mean, he... he was just, like, a genuine, honest guy-- you know, what he said, you just believed what he said. You can just tell he wants to have some fun. He hasn't had fun yet, so, uh... we'll bring lots of fun his way. We'll keep him entertained."
7,19,Rudy,Jenna and Sean are going to have a good time talking. I don't know which one talks the most. She ain't shut up since she's been here.
7,19,Jenna,"I immediately saw the table set up with... it was like a romantic dinner. It was like this table all set up with everything, two beds off to the right single, like, really nice sheets and pillows and blankets, and, uh... like, a stump, we had a bedside table, we had lanterns everywhere, tiki torches, and the first thing I thought was... ""Oh, man, they're so setting this up for it to be romantic with Sean"" and there's just... there's not a spark there."
7,19,Sean,"But I often give a bad first impression sometimes. (12:59 → 13:08 = 9s) They wanted it to be more romantic than it was ever going to be, but, uh... you know, from either end of us, but we really had an exceptional time, and we tied one on, you know, uh, finished the bottles of wine, and we ate like kings and queens, and, uh, it was fantastic."
7,19,Jenna,"Uh, we saw Pagong's fire was still lit so I was like, ""Oh, I want to call home. They're probably worried."" And, uh, so we threw a bunch of kerosene on our fire to make it whoosh, and they said they saw that, so I… I hoped that they would figure that I was still there, that I was okay."
7,19,Jenna,"We talked all night. It-it helped that they had four bottles of wine there. So we drank them all and, uh, we were both pretty drunk."
7,20,Gretchen,"We're just waiting 'cause no one's given us any information. So, I mean, last night we were wondering where she was. And then somebody said ""Well, she can't come back until the negotiations are over."" But there's really nothing to negotiate. We could have made a shelter in that time. We could have made-- whatever they're negotiating for, we could have moved our whole camp-- been done in that time. So I don't, I don't know what the whole process is about."
7,20,Gervase,"We miss Jenna. We haven't seen Jenna at all since she's left, and we were kind of worried about her last night when it got dark and she wasn't here."
7,20,Greg,"I'd be wasting my time and energy to, uh, guess what's happening. So I don't even bother. What's going on? It's a beautiful day. The sun's nice. You can see, uh, Mount Kinabalu and, uh, we're going to go fishing."
7,20,Richard,"They talked about some kind of a negotiation, and I would imagine if the two parties had opposing views as to what camp they should move to that the negotiation might go on-- or might be interesting. But since both parties, as far as we know, want to move to this camp, I can't imagine what's going on on the sand spit."
7,20,Susan,"We're not sure yet, because Sean has been gone almost 24 hours now since we sent him off on the messenger thing. So the anticipation of waiting for Sean is just actually starting to drive us wild."
7,20,Sean,"And we told Pagong the unfortunate news that they had five minutes to pack their things-- get their luxury item and choose three items, uh, which we decided were the wool blanket that they have, the mosquito netting, so we could sleep under the mosquito netting, and the, um, cooking pot."
7,20,Jenna,"Actually, Sean let me do almost all of the deciding. I came up with the name, he added an ""a"" on the end."
7,20,Sean,"Jenna came up with the name. It had to be, uh, something that was indigenous to the island and, you know, we have a lot of rattan wood here. And, uh, we just added an ""a"" to make it sound more exotic. That was my idea. You know, give it a little flair, a little pizzazz."
7,20,Greg,"You know, they come back having had a great night and ""Oh, my God, I can't wait to tell you guys how much we've eaten."" And that's wonderful. That's how ambassadors should be treated. But, you know, of course, when you're on an island surviving on white rice and the occasional fish... Hey, tell me a little bit more about it. I'd love to hear about butter sauce. Like... thanks!"
7,20,Gervase,"I mean, it just makes more sense to go to their side. I mean, I think that's what everybody wanted to do anyway. Everybody wanted to get out of this section just for a new change of scenery. I mean, we've been here for 20 days. We've seen it. We know it. So it was just like, you know, let's try something new."
7,20,Colleen,"Sean was even saying there's enough room for us in the hutch because enough people sleep outside, so... It's going to go quick. God, I hope it goes quick from here on out, you know. Really."
7,20,Gretchen,"When I first got here, I... you know, I think maybe I would have been more comfortable on the other team, because I, you know, from what I understand, they like pulled their camp together, they got their stuff hanging up, which is, like, something that's been bothering me since the day we got here, and... but I think it was good for me to be with this tribe because, um, you don't have to work all the time and you don't have to be busting butt. It's nice to... you know, we’re, we're healthy and we're happy and we spend a lot of time having fun. So I think it taught me something, too. You can be, you know, very comfortable and I don't feel like I need to bust butt all the time, and I've had a good time while I'm here. So I’m glad, you know, I'll be glad to go with the other tribe and I was glad to be with this tribe."
7,20,Greg,"It's like starting over. We've left behind a lot of things-- a lot of material possessions. Um, metaphysically, we've also left behind a lot of emotional issues. Um... there was a lot of baggage that we left on that... on that Pagong Beach."
7,20,Jenna,"I did feel sadness when we left Pagong. Like looking back, that was where we rode to the first day when we were shipwrecked. It was where I'd formed a bond with eight... seven other people, so... it was sad. But it was like a new beginning for me-- a whole 'nother tribe."
7,20,Colleen,"So Rich came out, it was like ""Hey, how are you?"" You know, he swam out, which was really nice."
7,20,Jenna,They welcomed us with open arms. We got along really well.
7,20,Richard,"So, what they were really doing was coming to the beach and, uh, were moving in with what things they could have gotten together in the five minutes that they had to get together, I guess. I was glad to see that."
7,20,Greg,"A boy named Sue. Strong, loud, with an accent that'll drive you up the wall!"
7,20,Jenna,"I think, uh, Rudy's very set in his ways, so having, you know, five new people move in, it scared him a lot, so he was just sitting back and he was assessing the situation, I think."
7,20,Rudy,"All of a sudden, we doubled our population. Uh, the-the house got smaller, the pots got smaller, and, uh... personally, it's a pain in the ass."
7,20,Kelly,"It's almost too good. Like, everybody's too... Like, ""Oh, you go first."" ""No, you go first,"" oh, you know, everybody's being real, real super polite, you know, which is cool."
7,20,Colleen,"Sean is very intelligent. Sometimes he says interesting things. Sometimes you tune out for a while, and then he hits on something so you tune back in, you know. I mean, he's always going."
7,20,Greg,"Rich is clever and, uh... I mean we'll start being honest now. I think Rich thinks he's very clever. He is, uh, relatively sharp, and, uh... he has a lot of things going on in his mind that he, uh... selectively decides, uh, what he will share and with whom. Rich is playing a big game, which is very fun, so he's awfully entertaining."
7,20,Kelly,"That... it was suggested... that we should, you know, ""beef up"" the supports and everything. Okay, which, you know, I don't know, I don't know anything about shingles and roofing, and I just know how to tie knots, that's pretty much all I know how to do."
7,20,Kelly,"And, bam, shingles break, the whole roof comes crashing down. Felt like such an idiot."
7,20,Sean,It figures that the day that everyone shows up the whole roof caves in while they're repairing it.
7,20,Susan,"Yeah, it's the same as it is back home, ladies, here in the jungle. The women are doing all the work and the guys are just hanging out and b.s.'ing, yeah."
7,20,Sean,"The guys are kind of bumming around, but I think that's good 'cause I think all the guys got to get to know each other."
7,20,Colleen,"It's how men and women relate, you know. The women-- we work together and we... it's a little... women are always a little bit competitive in everything we do, you know, so it's like when you're working together you're seeing what the other person can do, and you're proving each other at the same time. Men can sit down and talk for hours and walk away friends."
7,20,Richard,"Gervase was great. I beat the hell out of him in a number of games that I've never played before, and he's, uh, he's good at cards. I think he could have been letting me win. Uh, who knows? He could be playing the odds, too."
7,20,Gervase,"It's natural to me. What I do, I don't think I'm doing anything special. I'm just being myself. But other people always say, like, ""You're a charmer."" ""You're a smooth talker."""
7,20,Richard,"Greg's an interesting character. He's young, too. He's 24, and he was, uh, pretty cocky. He was thinking he could go out and get something, came back in with a sea urchin. (derisive chuckling) But that was good, that shows people that he who thought he was a spearfishing person could go out there, no problem, comes from the other tribe and came back in, telling everybody just how difficult it is-- that ups my value even more."
7,20,Jenna,"First night as one tribe we sat around the campfire, told stories-- very, very, very revealing stories."
7,20,Kelly,"Gretchen said she drank a fifth of whiskey in two minutes when she was fourteen and that-that’s... I would have never guessed that about her, you know? Sounds like we kind of have a similar past. (laughs)"
7,20,Greg,"This new group is, like, it's like a banquet. It's like a banquet of stories and excitement."
7,20,Rudy,"Some of the stuff they talk about don't interest me and I don't want to hear it. I don't know. They talk, uh... about a lot of sex stuff."
7,21,Gretchen,"It rained again last night and we had to, um, rebuild the roof of their shelter yesterday and I think half of it is leak-proof and half of it doesn't have a roof, and so a lot of us got very wet. And it's frustrating because we had just moved from a shelter that we had worked out all the bugs in and kept us 90% dry."
7,21,Rudy,"I was in there last night and, uh, when the rain came all them women eased down our way and I had about five women in my lap all of a sudden."
7,21,Colleen,Rudy was kicking me in the head. He doesn't care.
7,21,Jenna,"Oh, yeah, people were getting kicked in the head all night long because he got out like, three times and he would just barrel through people."
7,21,Rudy,"I mean, the pillows were right across me, and I had to get up and go to the head and I couldn't."
7,21,Gretchen,"I don't know. Rudy kicked me in the head, like, three times last night and I said, ""Rudy, that's my head,"" and he said, ""Well this is my space, so..."" (laughs)"
7,21,Rudy,"Hey, I'm the old guy, don't forget. Them young guys might have liked it. It's a pain in the ass to me."
7,21,Richard,"But even though we aren't any longer two different teams, I still have a team. It's going to be interesting because we're not solid. We're solid with one another, but we're not solidly unbeatable yet just by circumstance, because there are only four of us and there are ten people still left on the island."
7,21,Kelly,"When you get in that Tribal Council and you walk up and you see that little piece of paper and the thing that you put the vote in-- it's all different. You know, you might... you might have a thought and say, ""Hey, I really don't want to vote this person off."" It's easier said than done. An alliance is easier said than done."
7,21,Greg,"If people are fear- and self-preservation-motivated they'll band together, they'll form alliances, they'll start beating people out to try and get rid of the strong ones and get rid of this and get rid of that, and, uh, you know, if that happens I hope they vote me off really soon because, uh, that to me is-- whoa, cool flying fish-- that to me is really boring."
7,21,Jenna,"Coming into this merger, I consider it a brand-new tribe. I want a vote based on people's merits. I don't want a vote based on, uh, ""Let's get rid of each of them first and then come back to our tribe."" I... I want a vote based on, uh, who I really think should go, whether it be a member of our tribe or a member of theirs."
8,22,Sean,"Today is, like, Day 22. We had a vote last night, which is always pretty beat. Always puts us in a pretty somber mood. But last night was a very strange vote."
8,22,Jenna,"Last night, it looks like there was a conspiracy, and maybe I'm being paranoid and I didn't want to believe it, but four people from Tagi voted for Gretchen, I think."
8,22,Sean,"You know, the bloodbath has begun, you know. People have started taking it a different way, 'cause there's really no good reason other than strategy to vote Gretchen off."
8,22,Gervase,"I really don't know what happened last night. At first sight, it looks like they, uh, just picked Gretchen off."
8,22,Rudy,It was my idea to get rid of Gretchen because I... I thought that she was going to be the next leader.
8,22,Richard,"She had to go because she... is bright and, uh, is strong and she was a threat."
8,22,Kelly,"This is a game; don't take it personally. You know, if people came here to make, you know, bosom buddies and, you know, lifelong friends, they should've gone to summer camp."
8,22,Jenna,"As far as Pagong, we are now four. They are now five. They do have a voting bloc on us whether we see it or not and they can pick us off one by one. My best strategy is to bond with the women and try to hold on to the women's vote as long as I can."
8,22,Susan,"Yeah, the women seem to be getting along well because the women are all workers. Actually, I like Jenna better than I thought I would. I thought she would drive me wild and she doesn't, so..."
8,22,Jenna,"I do see the women versus men vote continuing on in Rattana. As far as my three votes, top-- they're all men. I see women go out, get the crab traps. The women fix the hut. We're carrying the weight of the team. Maybe that's unfair, but that's how I see it."
8,22,Susan,"As far as the women becoming an alliance, there's a chance that the girls might want to have an alliance after there's a few more guys knocked off. If they do, I'll just lead on with them like, ""Yeah, that's a good idea."" But as far as the women forming an alliance and making one, no. It ain't gonna happen. I already got mine. I like mine."
8,22,Kelly,"We're all hungry and we're low on energy, and there's still no one else providing any food except for Rich. And we're having to ration the rice."
8,22,Rudy,"Having nine people, uh, it's, uh... everything gets smaller again. The rice pot got smaller, the sleeping quarters got smaller."
8,22,Susan,"I wish some of the other people would start conserving a little more... I mean, people that are being pigs. And I tell myself, I'll only eat one bowl at a sitting. I'm planning on staying until the end, so I really want to have something for the last couple of days."
8,22,Gervase,We have our fisherman; it's Rich. That's Rich's job. (08:20 → 08:33 = 13s)
8,22,Gervase,"Greg showing up, going out trying to spear a fish. They've got nothing. I'm not going to do any better than they will, you know. And I think Rich is in a great position. We vote Rich off, we don't eat."
8,22,Richard,"As far as who voted for me at the Tribal Council last night... and I'm not certain who it is. But I'm thinking it was probably Greg who felt threatened by me. But it could have been any of them. I've only been with them a day or two and I'd not brought in any fish. Today, on the other hand I brought in a huge catch. Three rays... They just lapped that up. (09:24 → 09:39 = 15s)"
8,22,Richard,"I could eat rice for 17 more days. I could eat rice the whole time, but they're loving the fish and it seems to make people feel great, and I squeeze every ounce of credit out of it that I can. (laughs)"
8,22,Greg,"Rich is playing a big game. I think Rich thinks he's very clever. He has a lot of things going on in his mind that he, uh... selectively decides, uh, what he will share and with whom."
8,22,Richard,I'm not sure how Greg sees me. I'm trying to figure out whether or not he's trying to build an alliance or pull me in or make me like him in some way.
8,22,Jenna,"I'm seeing Greg in a much more devious way than I've ever seen him before. Since we moved, I saw him change so much, and so transparently, to me anyway, that I've changed my whole attitude towards Greg."
8,22,Greg,"This scheme is interesting in that you make friends with people, you make alliances and then you’re gonna have to cut them loose at some point."
8,22,Jenna,"Greg is working just about everybody in the group. I think he's always had Colleen, like, wrapped around his little finger."
8,22,Colleen,"It's not like that. I mean, honestly, if there was a girl here who I got along with really, really well, it would be the same thing that way. I feel like I have a friend and I have somebody who's my equal that I can actually have a conversation with."
8,22,Greg,"This is the game. You bring this little kitty along. You have your little kitten, and you pet your kitten and you enjoy this kitten and the kitten sleeps with you every night and then, uh, you're hungry, man. You look right in the kitten's eye and snap its neck. It's nothing personal. You're hungry. The kitten has to give its life for the next level."
8,22,Kelly,I see him as being a chameleon. Changing his colors to fit whoever he's around.
8,22,Richard,"He's certainly interacted with me in an incredibly interesting way that suggests to me that he's trying something that I'm very, very wary of and that's great."
8,22,Jenna,"Rich finds Greg attractive, so Rich throws these little innuendos out there and Greg will just pick right up on them, sit right real close to Rich and he's playing him."
8,22,Gervase,"Greg and Rich have joked around a lot. We were talking one night. Rich was getting real personal about his business, and Greg was all in it."
8,22,Greg,"I think, uh, Rich likes to flirt with everybody, and instead of directly shutting him down, I only played his game back."
8,22,Richard,"He's manipulative. He's trying to win me over in some way. He's just not going about it in bright enough a way for me. I would like to spend more time with him and get to know him, but... I would also rather have the million dollars than to have somebody like him around to worry about."
8,23,Kelly,"The reward is going to be something from home and, um, Jenna's thinking it's-it's our pictures that we got to bring, and, like, she really, really... She misses her daughters terribly."
8,23,Greg,"If it's going to be funny, which I figured it would, I thought other people might get a kick out of it. Like, at least she could provide entertainment for other people."
8,23,Richard,Well I didn't think Greg's tape was unusual. I expected that and was excited by it. You could tell she was having fun and knew he would laugh at what she was doing and I was laughing. I loved it.
8,23,Sean,I definitely see Greg differently now after seeing his video and attaching a lit bit of a family with him. At least we know he's not the only screwball in his family. Maybe it's a genetic trait over there.
8,23,Rudy,"I can't understand a guy talking to his sister that way. It sounded like Greg was, uh, talking, maybe, incest. That's the way it sounded to me."
8,23,Greg,"(laughing) Why not make allusions? It crosses all those borders. And, God, what are people going to think? And then, sexual allusions for my sister? What's gonna happen?!"
8,23,Jenna,"(weeping) I can't imagine anybody missing their kids more than I do every night. Miss my beauties. Miss Sadie and Sabrina. I can't imagine my mom not getting the tape out. It would've done wonders to see that my kids are okay. To hear their voices. To hear, ""I love you, Mommy."" (looks away from the camera crying)"
8,24,Richard,"Yesterday was cool. We had that Reward Challenge with the bow and arrow and the reward was, the, uh... videotapes from home, and for me, that was way better than food."
8,24,Gervase,"Now, seeing those videos of everybody's family, it's, like, even if you didn't like somebody before, you see that somebody cares and loves this person, so it makes it harder for me to boot somebody off now."
8,24,Kelly,"I felt so bad for Jenna. She practiced all morning on that stupid bow and arrow and then it was just, like, ""Why bother"" for her."
8,24,Jenna,Those are my bruises from the bow and arrow. (shows bruised elbow) This is from the bow and arrow.
8,24,Greg,I don't know what her feeling is because now it seems like she wants to leave the island and see her girls.
8,24,Gervase,"Jenna is a threat to me because she has kids and I have kids, so we're, like, single parents, and if people feel for single parents and she's tugging on people's emotions right there and that can sway somebody not to vote for Jenna, and that's a threat for me."
8,24,Jenna,Gervase? I don't see him doing very much.
8,24,Susan,The fact you have more people here now and we're having to forage for more food and there's a lot more slackers on this other team.
8,24,Gervase,"My work philosophy is this: Rich is, like, the resident fisherman; Rudy's the cook; Sean is hauling in wood every day-- you know, it seems like everybody has a role here-- and I'm just sitting back relaxing."
8,24,Susan,Watch me-- I'm going to work that boy till he's gone now. He bugs me.
8,24,Greg,"Gervase is honest. He's not playing anybody else's game. I've said over and over that he was an example for people thrown out of their element to really succeed and have a great time, which Gervase has."
8,24,Gervase,"How have I survived this long? I always said when I came here, I was going to be the entertainer. I'm not trying to do anything shifty or shady; I'm just being me and people like me because that's who I am."
8,24,Susan,"Gervase is not that charming, trust me. He's a slacker, so he won't be around long."
8,24,Jenna,I knew coming here that we'd have to vote people off. What I didn't bank on was the feelings that you'd have towards these people.
8,24,Kelly,I feel like I feel every Tribal Council only it gets worse every time. I feel like a backstabber. I feel like a liar.
8,24,Colleen,"God, some people are so nervous, it's sick. It's sick how nervous some people are."
8,24,Rudy,"People are all looking around a little more because it's starting to get down to the wire, and, uh, evidently, we're the only ones with a plan right now."
8,24,Greg,"The voting now should get very interesting. If people are fear- and self-preservation motivated, they'll band together. They'll form alliances. They'll start beating people out. But fear-motivated self-preservation is the worst game I can imagine."
8,24,Kelly,"How do you, you know, stay true to yourself and maintain integrity and still play this game? And you know what? You can't."
8,24,Rudy,"It's cut and dried that we can eliminate somebody every time, and if we don't, I'll have to break somebody's kneecap or something."
8,24,Susan,"So as long as everybody can keep their mouth shut now. Kelly's a little freaky. She's gets a little going. I'm like, ""Just shut up. Just vote this, and shut up."""
8,24,Kelly,"I keep telling myself ""Well, I have enough friends. I didn't come here to make friends,"" and, you know, da-da-da. And the truth is, I like these people."
8,24,Susan,"As far as there being a counter-strategy from the other side, yeah, there is some fear about that because we haven't got enough of them voted off yet."
8,24,Colleen,"We have the upper hand right now, easy. We have four people that we could come together have a vote, and get the next person off."
9,25,Richard,"Outright lying is absolutely essential, especially when you have a host like Jeff, who's as bold as to ask ""Well, so Sue, tell me, is there an alliance?"" What a question."
9,25,Susan,"You think I'm going to come out and say ""Oh, yeah, we got four of us voting up against all you guys. We're going to knock you all down to the end."" Come on."
9,25,Colleen,"Those people flat out lied in front of a national television audience. I mean, they want a million bucks and they're going to get it... And I loved Jeff's question ""Is, uh, a deserving person going to win this money?"" The answer to that question is ""no."""
9,25,Kelly,"This whole alliance thing is getting too stupid and too crazy. If we stick with it, it's just like lining lambs to the slaughter. Who goes next? Who goes...? like, that's no fun. Yeah, I don't like it. I-I'm not happy playing the game that way. If I'm going to win, if I'm really going to be the last Survivor, if I'm really going to survive and really do this, then it has to be on my own."
9,25,Sean,"I love Rich, I really do. He's been a great asset to this camp, but he is a little immature in his motives at times. He's very protective about spearing fish and he brings it up at every Island Council: ""I'm catching fish. Don't vote me off."" It's an insecurity aspect to him."
9,25,Richard,"The last Island Tribal Council when I was talking about, um... ""I'll be staying around here because I'm providing fish"" was an outright blatant lie. I'm staying around here 'cause I'm bright. It has nothing to do with catching fish. Catching fish makes people happy, but that's not why they're voting me here. They're not voting me off because I'm not letting them."
9,25,Colleen,"Do you see them bringing these stingrays and stuff in? They're, like, still flapping around and they take this dull knife, and they chop off their head. It's disgusting. If I choose to watch my dinner that came from the sea be killed or not be killed, I would rather not watch it be killed."
9,25,Susan,"When Rich came in with the fish, I said to Rudy, I said, ""I should go and stoke that fire up."" And Rudy's, like, ""Oh, no, no, no, that's good enough. It's hot enough,"" and it wasn't hot enough. (07:18 → 07:30 = 12s)"
9,25,Susan,"The fish is tough to cook because they cooked a little bit and then they cooled off and they had to start the fire back up and cook the fish again, so Rich is sort of irritated."
9,25,Richard,"Rudy's clueless when it comes to fish, and, um, you know, really ruined it. Nobody knew what to do with cooking the fish and so it sits here and it sits half on the heat, and it sits over there and it gets turned over halfway and it doesn't, and so it's half-cooked and overcooked and undercooked and half of the fish, half of the three rays were wasted... and that infuriates me. (08:09 → 08:23 = 14s)"
9,25,Richard,"So I was sitting there, just pissed off, really frustrated. I don't want anybody around, I don't want anybody near me when I'm frustrated, and people are sitting there, ""What's wrong?"" and that just makes it worse."
9,25,Richard,"I probably won't get fish actually for a little while now, anyway, because they need to appreciate it. I'm bringing in too many right now. I brought in a bunch yesterday and a bunch today and so we need to take a break and let them kind of hunger for it again."
9,25,Colleen,"So many times Rich opens his mouth, and I just want to be, like, ""Oh, be quiet over there in the corner. You're not making any sense, and you think you're so smart and you're... just go home, and go get your liposuction and go catch more fish, 'cause you're bugging me."" You know, he thinks he's so above everybody and is full of baloney, really."
9,25,Kelly,"The hardest part now is... (sighs) the food. We're hungry and Rich is the only one that can fish. We've gone fishing in the morning. We've gone in the afternoon. We’ve gone at night. We're not catching any fish. It bothers me that I can't get my own food, that I have to rely on someone else."
9,25,Susan,"We caught a fish today, finally-- yes!-- and it feels so good. I feel so accomplished now."
9,25,Jenna,"I think, uh, it disappointed Rich that us girls kept these crab traps going and that we caught a fish."
9,25,Susan,"He's going to make a big point ""Oh, that ain't a lot to feed you,"" but it's a point that we did catch it. So, I don't give a (expletive censor) about how he's going to see it. I don’t care. We caught it; I feel accomplished. I did it… we've done it all now. (11:02 → 11:16 = 14s)"
9,25,Susan,"But, yeah, he's going to be... I think it might bother him. In a way, I hope it does. I hope it bugs him, 'cause now he can't say that no more, you know? 'Cause us girls caught this one."
9,26,Sean,"I love getting mail and there was a log hanging above our mailbox. It looked an awful lot like part of the tree, but, uh, when I took it down, there was a sign on there a little a nursery rhyme, it says: (says 1st verse in front of the group) ""then you'll be home free, (says 3rd verse in front of the group) then go climb a tree."" I'm sure the game is anything but simple, just, like, just pick a rope and run."
9,26,Rudy,I'm prepared to eat rice tonight... (chuckles) like every night.
9,26,Jenna,"I want the letter from home more because I can go back and get rice, but I haven't seen or heard anything from my kids."
9,26,Kelly,"That's it, I'm going big, going for all of it."
9,27,Sean,"Rich's birthday is today, and it's his 39th birthday and, uh, he celebrated immediately by taking off all of his clothes and celebrating in his birthday suit... which you never get used to seeing Richard naked."
9,27,Richard,I'm 39 today and I had intended for quite a long time to celebrate my birthday naked.
9,27,Jenna,"And I'm sure he does love to be naked, and I'm glad for that and I thought I'd be okay with that, but sitting at the fire this morning and he comes just walking up and sits, like, two inches from me naked... I wanted to get away. It felt awkward sitting next to a naked gay man, and if he had, like, something to cover the butt crack area I'd be cool with that."
9,27,Rudy,"When I go home, my wife asks me about-- ""Well, who was with you?"" I'll say, ""A queer that ran around bare-ass half of the time,"" for one thing."
9,27,Colleen,"Rich wanted to be naked for his birthday. Oh, fun. Show off a little more. I mean, he was doing it for shock value. It's goofy. Who walks around naked 24/7?"
9,27,Richard,"Colleen was particularly uncomfortable with my nakedness and when she saw me naked, she just made a funny face and put her hands over her face and who knows what that's intended to signal?"
9,27,Colleen,I love that Rich gets annoyed with me-- that makes me happy-- and he really has in the past two days and it just makes me want to egg him on more.
9,27,Gervase,"It's crunch time now. It's getting down to the final wire and I'm amazed that I'm still here and I got 12 days left. It's not even a strategy. I'm just really focused now, on winning these challenges. I'm trying to think, ""How did I lose yesterday and how can I stop that from happening again today?"" 'Cause today is even bigger than the food when it comes down to it. You know, I'd rather not eat and get that Immunity Challenge every time."
9,27,Sean,I think it adds a new dimension to the game of me going alphabetically. (23:25 → 23:37 = 12s)
9,27,Sean,"Uh, I'm going in alphabetical order-- Jenna is next. It would make me happy if Gervase does not win, uh, immunity this time 'cause I had to skip him last time-- you know, I skipped him in the order-- and, uh, maybe Jenna will win it and get out of the order."
9,27,Kelly,"Sean's going around telling everybody ""Don't be in the alliance. Don't..."" um... ""vote your…” you know, “vote your conscience."" Meanwhile, he's going around preaching everyone to vote their conscience and he's, like, ""Oh, okay, alphabetically."""
9,27,Gervase,"Sean... I like Sean. Sean's a great guy, you know, but about Sean's alphabetical order. It's like my granddaddy used to say: ""If you want to be seen, stand up, if you want to be heard, speak up, and if you want to be appreciated, shut up."""
9,27,Colleen,"We had fun, you know? We had-- Pagong was a good, was a good place to live. Now we moved into the new neighborhood with the nasty neighbors. (laughs) (31:01 → 31:14 = 13s)"
9,27,Colleen,"The people who came in swinging were Rich and Sue. They knew. They're smart. They're very smart people... Although Rich is just a numskull. God! People are wishy-washy. They're conniving and they're stupid, and that's what's happening, and it's all out in the open for everybody to see. The decision that I feel I'm left with is do I interact with these people, have fun and just wait till my ticket comes up or do I try and strategize and try and make a difference?"
9,27,Jenna,"Yesterday, at the dinner, we had a whole conversation about forming a new alliance. We're going to vote the same and we figure that this puts us in jeopardy for the next one, but we were in jeopardy anyway, so..."
9,27,Gervase,"Well, we tried the ""be nice, honor"" way. It didn't work, so don't be stupid anymore. It's just, we're smarter now. We saw that that way didn't work, so we got to switch gears."
9,27,Colleen,"Jenna and I were just, you know, goofing off and, uh, Kelly decided to join in. And, so I feel bad for Kelly because here she wants to play. And Rich is, like, ""Something's happened to you since these girls came. I'm really worried about you,"" kind of putting her in her place and makes her feel a little self-conscious. By her being nervous and wishy-washy about where her loyalties lie, it's really making Sue and Rich nervous."
9,27,Richard,"Kelly's acting a little odd. She's dressing like the other two that are her age, and I'm hoping that Kelly hasn't, uh, shifted trust and-and joined forces with somebody else."
9,27,Rudy,"I thought about a female alliance and watching them, the way they walk around, hand in hand. I even thought about lesbianism, but, uh, maybe not. I don't know. And, uh, it could happen if they had any brains, but I don't think they got enough brains to do that."
9,27,Kelly,"I probably will have the swing vote tonight. I'd said before, you know, alliance or no alliance, there's two people that I have in mind to vote off and they're two people that, um, are-are competition, but, um, they annoy me and... (chuckling) they're kind of suck-y to live with."
9,27,Colleen,I really don't know what's going to happen at Tribal Council tonight. I know I'm voting for Rich. I know Jenna's voting for Rich. I know Gervase is voting for Rich.
9,27,Gervase,"As long as he's catching fish, people are gonna try to keep him around, so I say, get rid of Rich and we all starve together."
9,27,Jenna,"The rest of my alliance, if that's what you want to call it? Yeah, we're all voting for Rich. He's ruthless and the fact that we're voting him out on his birthday-- it's not lost on me. We're giving him a birthday present."
10,28,Kelly,"It's weird the day after anybody leaves there's just, there's just this void of, ""Oh, wait,"" you know, ""someone's... someone's not here."""
10,28,Rudy,Gervase was going to get voted off the last time but at the last minute they changed it to Jenna. And I think that that was the women's idea.
10,28,Susan,"The sun is out, it's going to be a nice hot day. And it's quieter. Sorry, Jenna, but, man, you talk a lot."
10,28,Gervase,"It's like 11 days left. I'm totally shocked that I'm still here right now. If you look at it since the merger it's only been Pagong people being voted off. You know, so it's like... something's fishy going on. You know, they can deny an alliance all they want but there's got to be an alliance."
10,28,Sean,"No, I'm not 100% sure. If there is an alliance, they are just voting in block, you know, but I don't know if there is one. I haven't been asked to partake in one or anything yet."
10,28,Colleen,"Dirk got four votes. Gretchen got four votes. Greg got four votes. Sean, come on, open your eyes. Sean is interesting because I'm debating right now if I want to vote him off at the next Council. Because he's so scared of hurting somebody's feelings by voting for them that he's voting alphabetical order. I mean, he led the way for Jenna to be kicked off yesterday."
10,28,Richard,And last night at the Council Sean realized that his vote impacted who gets voted off because we only used... needed to use three of our four allied people's votes to get Jenna ejected.
10,28,Sean,"Whatever vote I was going to go they were going to copy. If I knew that I would, I would certainly have abandoned this strategy earlier."
10,28,Colleen,"It's like Sean walked into this and somebody forgot to tell him it was a game. And he's very concerned about people's emotions and feelings, which is wonderful you know, if you're taking care of a pet. You know, not if you're playing a game called Survivor and the point of the game is to strategize and eliminate people."
10,28,Sean,"It just felt a little scummy to me at the time but after last night where the remaining tribe members of both parties said, “Yeah, we really don't care, it's just a game.” Every single one of them has tried to form a strategy with me personally."
10,28,Richard,"Now people are talking about planning and plotting and strategy. (chuckles) And it's just so funny. So utterly, utterly, utterly naive that there would be any room left to plot or strategize now."
10,28,Gervase,"Rich is very arrogant, very cocky and very, very overconfident. And I thought, “You know what? Let's take Rich down a couple pegs.”"
10,28,Gervase,"Rich was this close to leaving last week. That was a good feeling. For me, it was just a great feeling. And you could see it's affected Rich. After those three votes, Rich was... he-he couldn't believe it. Rich even thinks I, uh... formed an alliance against him last night. Which I didn't."
10,28,Richard,"When I fish is somewhat strategic. So I'm thinking to myself it would be a heck of a lot more valuable I guess to me, if I got fish after a couple more folks were gone. And I'll limit the fish that I'm getting so that I'm not out here working my ass off and people just expect that there will be lots of fish."
10,28,Susan,"I don't blame him one bit for not worrying about fishing till there's five people. That's a lot of mouths to feed, you know, and they don't appreciate it."
10,28,Richard,"There are analogies between my going out to the reef and hunting the fish and my picking off the, uh, tribe members one by one. I've been stalking them since before we got on the island. Bye-bye, baby. It's a slow, more methodical game here on the island with each of the tribe members than it is with the fish but there are similarities. That's probably the last fish I'll get until there are five. There are seven participants right now and I probably won't bother to get any more fish until there are five people."
10,28,Susan,"Colleen and Gervase are just sitting over there and I'm like, ""You backstabbers."" First you want him out of here, and then you're all over the food. (09:07 → 09:18 = 11s)"
10,28,Susan,"My strategy all along has been to just play the role as a dumb redneck. People like, think rednecks are so vulnerable and dumb that they'll talk to them openly. Like Rich did, (laughs) you know, how he's going to burn everybody. Hopefully in the end the, the old redneck will burn the city slickers. So we'll see what happens. (09:50 → 09:59 = 9s) I've been knowing all along that I'm going to burn him but I didn't want to say anything to Kelly too early. (10:04 → 10:15 = 11s)"
10,28,Susan,"I never trusted Rich. Of course I don't trust him. But am I doing a good job making him think I trust him? I hope it looks like I trust him now. Right now I don't trust anybody except for Kelly. I trust Kelly 100%. 100%, And she trusts me the same. We're like sisters."
10,28,Kelly,I really like Sue a lot. We've bonded quite a bit in these 30 days.
10,28,Susan,"And it'll be 20 years come this Easter that I lost my best friend. So, coming across Kelly, somebody I can hang with... that's a long... I ain't going to ... her. I'm not burning her."
10,28,Kelly,"The only person I trust is Sue, and sometimes I-I doubt that. It's getting to that point where you don't know who you can trust."
10,28,Susan,I'd rather just me and Kelly burn him. Just because it'll feel so good.
10,28,Richard,"If the alliance were to break down and something else happened that I wasn't aware of I would shake those people's hands and say congratulations you, you know, brilliant good job, you got it because you've fooled me."
10,28,Susan,Me and Kelly are taking him down.
10,28,Gervase,"It's real simple. I have two kids from a previous relationship: Dawnelle's ten, Genelle is seven. I'm with Carmela now Kayla with her and now Gunner. You know, Kayla's two and Gunner's the new addition."
10,28,Rudy,"When I was brought up, if a girl was pregnant and wasn't married, you'd never even know it. I mean, they'd take her out of town or somewhere. It was that bad, you know. The girl could have had an abortion. I-I'll agree with an abortion. But not having kids out of wedlock."
10,29,Rudy,Ten more days-- it'll all be over. I'll probably never see these people again. The way I want it.
10,29,Gervase,"Going to make my phone call to my family. See how everybody's doing, make sure they're doing good."
10,29,Richard,"I certainly don't judge him for being not married and having kids. I mean, he had one relationship, and then he had another relationship, and he seems to be in a relationship now with a woman where he's had two children, and is working toward a committed, long-term relationship to parent those children together."
10,29,Rudy,"I don't agree with babies out of wedlock that kind of garbage, you know? Half of the problem they got in this country today, there's no family life. And then they're blaming the schools. It starts way before them kids go to school. They need a family. They need somebody beating them in the head."
10,29,Kelly,This is not what I thought it was going to be like. It's not about surviving the elements. It's about surviving yourself. I didn't want to be a part of the alliance because I thought it was conniving and dirty and untrue to myself.
10,29,Gervase,"I don't think Kelly really wanted to make an alliance with anybody here in Tagi. I think they kind of strong-armed Kelly into making an alliance and joining their team, and it's really affected her personally, like, as a tug-of-war on the inside."
10,29,Kelly,"It's not worth it to feel like ... for the rest of your life, um, for a little bit of money, and your 15 minutes. You know, I kind of feel like Luke Skywalker, or something. I crossed over to the dark side for a moment. I don't like playing the game that way. Making a deal with Rich is kind of like making a deal with the devil. I decided a while ago not to be part of the big alliance. I've been pretty much letting Rich think that I'm still part of his little mind-game, follower thing the whole time, basically, because I figured if-if I did, you know, tell him that I grew a conscience and I didn't want to be his little follower anymore that he would turn around and shut me down, which I'm certain he would have, so, I'm glad I didn't... I didn't tell him. (22:58 → 26:10 = 12s)"
10,29,Kelly,Do I just kind of roll over and let Rich decide how it's all going to play out or do I try and beat him at his own damn game?
10,29,Colleen,"Kelly is really hard for me to talk with about voting and about alliances. I mean, because she could really be in for forming an alliance because you see her now being kind of pulled back and forth, you know? In one way, I think, she feels that she wants to, like, have fun and be young and, like, she said it. She was just like, ""I can't believe I'm in this group with these people."" She's like, ""It's awful."""
10,30,Gervase,"Rich got lucky and won his challenge and now he's... oh, man! Wait till you see him now. If you watch Rich the rest of this day watch the arrogance and the swagger he's walking around with 'cause he won that immunity and he knows he can't be touched tonight. I think Rich is the ringleader... Or if he's not the ringleader, then he's second in command. If I have to say, ""Do I know for a fact there's an alliance, and all this stuff is going on?"" No, I don't know for a fact, but I'm a smart guy, you know. I can see things and see how things are happening."
10,30,Kelly,"I-I was talking to-to Colleen and we were just, like, ""This sucks!"" You know, especially for her and Gerv. It's like they know they're leaving next so they're just going to sit around and wait you know, with a red dot pointed to their head?"
10,30,Gervase,"I think Rich-- being the cocky person that he is-- will think that they can get rid of me with three votes. Now, Sean approached me, saying he wouldn't, uh, mind making an alliance, but he said he would only do it if Kelly joined us so it'd be a sure thing. So they really only had their three core people: Rudy, Rich and Sue who probably definitely would be with the plan. That leaves four other votes, including mine that can go on somebody else. So somehow we have to work on Kelly and figure out who she's voting for and then maybe Colleen can also vote for that person. So, the best bet is Kelly."
10,30,Kelly,"I wish something exciting would happen-- something shocking, something that nobody expects."
10,30,Sean,Looks like we got some thunderheads building out there. Should provide for an exciting night.
10,30,Richard,"Kelly cut her own throat tonight and it was a wonderful thing. She, uh, tried to align herself to the kids her age and was probably trying to look a little, you know, nicer to the other group, but I have a feeling she's got more going on with them than she's letting on."
10,30,Richard,"It'll be interesting. She could have consequences. We haven't decided yet. (chuckles) ""We."" Hmm..."
11,31,Richard,"Just woke up. I'm wet. So, I guess it rained last night, but I slept through it. Today is the... 31st day... I think. All I know is, this is the ninth day till the end."
11,31,Kelly,"People were kind of miserable this morning. 'Cause I was one of the miserable. I mean, every day's a little tough because... we don't have a lot to do and we're-we're low energy. Rich has gotten really, really weak and really crabby and really hungry an-and Sean also."
11,31,Sean,"The food I miss, but not as much as my parents. The hardest part, uh, for me, about being here, um is that I miss my family and, uh... like I've reiterated a thousand times over I'm no mama's boy, but I'd really like to see my family. It would mean an enormous amount to me. When you think of their smiles and their hugs and stuff like that, I just can't wait to see them."
11,31,Kelly,Colleen's legs are pretty beat up. She's gotten some pretty bad gashes and she has some sores up higher on her legs that she doesn't know how she got.
11,31,Colleen,"My legs are bothering me. I mean, I would be lying if I said my legs aren't bothering me. They-they hurt a lot. I have all these and then, I have these new ones. I can't sleep because they itch so bad. So, I get a scar and then I itch it off and it... and it's just like this never-ending cycle and they're going to be like this for the next three years, you know? And bugs live in them. I mean, it's just awful. It's so awful. I am feeling like I've been here for 59,000 days. The past five days have been the longest five days of my entire life. I miss my old team. I miss my old beach, you know? I am the last Sole Survivor of the Pagong Tribe. I am a dying breed. Pagong gets picked off one by one. That's obvious. Now, I'm very confused at where alliances stand, and I think they're confused at where alliances stand. Rich and Sue are promising one thing to Sean... promising another thing to Kelly. Sue and Kelly are promising one thing to Rich... promising another thing to Sean, and then, Rudy just sits back and watch it all happen."
11,31,Richard,It seems like Kelly might be flip-flopping and planning strategies at our expense and that just ticked Sue off to no end.
11,31,Susan,"Kelly is staying in the alliance at this time, but she's trying to make herself look good to the other team in case it comes down to the end, and she's one of the last two standing that she will be, like, ""Oh, I didn't align with them, I didn't align with them"" and we're, like, ""This time, no, baby doll. You're not going to look good."""
11,31,Kelly,"I'm here to play the game. I'm going to play the da... game. I don't give a rat's ass what people think about me. I don't have to prove anything to anybody. I know who I am. So, who cares?"
11,31,Colleen,"That's what's so interesting about this is, I'm getting to see the breakdown of the Tagi alliance, which is really funny. Everybody is very concerned of the money at this point. Like Sean would say, ""It's a one-in-six chance of winning $1 million"" and nobody's going to throw that away."
11,31,Sean,"There comes a point where you have to turncoat a little bit, be a little more strategic, a little more self-preservative. It's a serious contest. There's a lot of money at stake and, uh, I'd better start treating it that way. No one's here just to make friends and shake hands and have relationships for the rest of the time."
11,31,Colleen,"This is definitely what happens when you put a big chunk of cheese in a maze and let all the mice go at it, you know? And see who eats who and who scrambles on top of who and I don't want to be any part of it. It's... not a fun game, no."
11,31,Rudy,"Well, we got a clue last night and, uh, it says you can use your brain, not your muscles, which is good news. Not that my brain's any good, but, uh... I'd rather use that than my muscles 'cause the muscles hurt now."
11,32,Sean,"Yesterday, I won a challenge-- an island trivia contest. The reward to the challenge was lucky for me, is a night on this luxurious yacht. I understand there's going to be food I hope dessert, a warm shower, television, maybe a newspaper. But, uh, hopefully I'll get to bring some company with me. If I'm allowed one person, I owe Kelly a dinner, so she's coming with me."
11,32,Kelly,"I really like Sean. I've probably talked a lot of trash about Sean 'cause he's neurotic and talks a lot, but he's really a good guy. If he does get to bring one person, he said he's going to bring me, so I'm a little stoked up about that. I might get to go spend a night on a yacht, which would be cool because if I could spend a night on a yacht and shower and eat some food, I'd be good to go for another seven days."
11,32,Sean,"This is an ungodly type of rain that we're not used to in the States. You know, I've seen some heavy rain-pours in New York City, but this is heavy, heavy rain, I mean, serious rain. This is really horrible. Survival of the fittest-- who can stand under an umbrella in the rain the longest?"
11,32,Kelly,"But that piece-of-crap parachute thing has been the most waterproof thing we've had on this whole island, so a lot of people have been crowding up underneath that."
11,32,Colleen,"Today it's raining. Last night was raining, and I think tomorrow it will probably be raining. (chuckles)"
11,32,Susan,"As far as the rain, well, I think it was a big deterrer on a lot of people. Really kind of ate at 'em. Oh, my God. I don't know if I'd want to live with some of them right now. Might be ornery, tired, hungry, cold..."
11,32,Kelly,Thank God for the sun. The sky's really clear and everybody's drying out and warming up. Good stuff.
11,32,Susan,"Sean finally leaves to go off to his yacht excursion and then he hollers out ""Hey! I can invite somebody for breakfast!"""
11,32,Susan,Sean makes up his mind and he invites Rich.
11,32,Kelly,"Sean kept saying how he was going to take me and then, last minute he said, ""Oh-- oh, Rich, you like eggs for breakfast, don't ya? Okay, me and you, Rich. I'll take you."""
11,32,Kelly,"You know, we're all hungry and tired and dirty and bored... He'll probably shave and bathe. Maybe he might get a massage. I just hope the poor kid doesn't make a fool out of himself."
11,32,Sean,"I thought the reward ample enough to spend a night on a yacht and get a massage, a shower, a shave... and to see my father then, I mean it was just a-a dream come true."
11,32,Kelly,"I just wish Sean would... just get a backbone sometimes. It irks me the way he tried to put it on me. Like, ""I'm going to bring you, but you can, you can pass it on to Rich if you want to."" Like he didn't want to be the (expletive censor) you know, he didn't want to have to make the decision that was his to make."
11,33,Richard,It's dawn and I'm looking at the yacht and Sean's probably still sleeping. But it won't be long before they come get me for breakfast.
11,33,Richard,It was good. It was enjoyable. I just kept eating while they talked and answered questions as I chewed.
11,33,Susan,Six more days of rice. I might even skip the last day of eating altogether just not to eat rice.
11,33,Colleen,"Sean is seeing that he's in a little bit of trouble, and he should probably have Rich out there because Rich is going to make sure that I get booted off tonight and not him. Maybe somewhere he's thinking that. He's smart if he's thinking that. I like that. Good job, Sean."
11,33,Rudy,"I-I can't figure out why he switched at the last minute, but he... all them ladies are pissed off at him."
11,33,Colleen,"When Sean's dad first came, to the tell you the truth, I almost cried because I started thinking about my mom and I miss her a lot. You know, Sean just gets all the breaks. But, uh, you know, it was good. I felt happy for him and he is the family kid, you know. So, it was, it was good for him. It was nice to have a new face around and stuff."
11,33,Susan,"Actually, for him to come and visit the camp was sort of cool, but he didn't know anything. We're like, “What's going on in the world?” He didn't know none of that. (25:41 → 25:55 = 14s)"
11,33,Susan,"Oh, he's just like Sean. He's lovable but a doof."
11,33,Susan,"Then right when he goes to leave this afternoon about an hour and a half, an hour ago, he has this gray bag. And in it is... there's a care package for each one of us. (26:33 → 26:47 = 14s)"
11,33,Susan,"So, in it we each got a little something from one of our loved ones from back home."
11,33,Colleen,"We all got thrown a bone, which was amazingly, wonderfully great, because now I feel like I can do this for six more days, and I definitely will... I'm on a sugar high right now, more than I have been in a month, so I feel like I can do anything right now."
11,33,Richard,"Sean's father came back with a-a bag filled with things for each of us from particular people, and this made it from, uh, the most wonderful woman on the planet-- Valerie. She just printed out the email that she was... had... was having with her husband who's another incredible man-- a close friend of mine-- and it just takes me back to my real world life and, uh, has my brain engaged and rejuvenated and out of these sixteen, whoever they are, people, and into who I am and just knowing what's going on and that's it's back there and what I'm about to experience when I go back and, you know, I can last the other whatever's left, seven days, six days."
11,33,Kelly,"This stupid alliance thing-- I don't even care about that anymore, you know? I say I'm not... I'm not in it anymore, I'm voting my conscience, and, you know, I want to be true to myself and who I am and keep my dignity-- who cares?"
11,33,Colleen,"Kelly-- she was a double agent, so to speak, you know, talking to the Pagong people, really trying to get in with them and then relaying everything we said to her teammates."
11,33,Sean,"The, uh, the Pagong people, fortunately picked up on that, 'cause they all came to me in unison and they said, ""I think Kelly's up to no good,"" and, uh, so... so it was very plastic, very see-through, and even her biggest advocate on this island, Sue, saw right through that."
11,33,Kelly,"I'm voting strategically. So are they, and they still think I'm in the stupid alliance because if I told them I didn't want to be, they'd vote me off, so I'm trying to save my own ass. So how bold and wonderful is that?"
11,33,Susan,"Me and Kelly, I thought, had a real friendship going. I really did. But, uh, when I turn around and see somebody starting to dig a knife into my backside, it just really pisses me off."
11,33,Kelly,"I don't care what I say to people. I don't care... if I'm nice to anybody at camp anymore. I do not give a (expletive censor), and it feels so good. It's great, I love it."
12,34,Richard,"There's no such thing as... for me, a Tagi Tribe or a Rattana. That was the stupidest thing I ever heard. Or... or any other tribe. It-it never existed and it doesn't exist. It's a group of sixteen people, four of whom were in an alliance with me and a bunch of other ones."
12,34,Sean,"Yeah, everyone's hunky-dory and all friends, but they all come to me and they say bad things about Richard, or they say bad things about Rudy, and then they go to Rudy and they say bad things about me, and they go to Rich, they say bad things about Rudy and I."
12,34,Rudy,"If somebody gave me their word that they are in this alliance with me, and I give my word, my word is good, and, uh, their word better be good. If they betray me, uh, I'll get even with them. (03:57 → 04:11 = 14s)"
12,34,Rudy,"I mean, it's-it's a game, but it's worth a million dollars. Money talks."
12,34,Kelly,"Rich is a smart guy and he's really tricky, and, uh, I don't trust him one bit. I never really have."
12,34,Richard,"Whatever it takes to win here is the point. Yeah, it's a game, and call it Machiavellian, sure."
12,34,Sean,"This is the most conniving bunch of people I've ever met in my life. There's not an honest one in the bunch. Conniving, conniving, conniving. Things are falling apart here at Rattana Beach."
12,34,Susan,Kelly made all the rest of us look like a bunch of idiots. Then she made all the rest of us look like the bad guys and her the one good guy out of the whole five of us. That's what irritated me.
12,34,Kelly,"Sue said many times that she wasn't part of an alliance either. So, now all of a sudden I'm two-faced and I (expletive censor) her when she had approached me and said, ""Hey, Rich and I have formed an alliance to vote you off at the end, but I'm not going to do that. Let's you and I vote him off."""
12,34,Richard,"When Kelly said to me, um, ""Are you pissed off at me? It seems to me like you and Sue are pissed off at me."" Well, that was my opportunity to come in and smooth things, as opposed to be the one who upsets the applecart. So certainly that little tiff between Kelly and, uh, Sue has been coming and plays to my advantage, absolutely."
12,34,Susan,"Aw, it hurts. This is my second ray sting since I've been here. Oh, and trust me, they hurt. It's like an aching sting and it hurts from my knuckle down to about here, and it's constantly pounding and it aches and it hurts really bad. I might act like a tough girl, but they do hurt. They gouge me. Yeah, this one got me good. Notice the hand. The knuckles are still swollen from that ray bite. I seen that tail come in and just slice that. Ow, was I pissed."
12,34,Richard,"Sixth day to the end. Desperate to go home. Really looking forward to enter reality. For me, this maintaining some kind of a thumb on ev... all of these different people's personalities that I care very little about, uh, is exhausting. I'm ready for the people in my life that I've brought into my life, throughout my life. And I'm looking forward to getting back to that with a vengeance."
12,34,Sean,"I've been wishing for home since the day I got here. I haven't been away from New York in this long ever. I miss my favorite restaurant. I miss the people at the restaurant. I miss my friends. I miss my family. You know, I miss all those things."
12,34,Susan,I'm just looking forward to talking to my husband on the phone. I can't wait for that.
12,34,Richard,"The end of days is what I'm thinking about as I lay here on a raft in the middle of the South China Sea on a beach-- in my bed. Yeah, it's very pretty. It's a beautiful, beautiful night. Cloudy, but I like the clouds. I'm just looking at the clouds, thinking of going home. Waiting... waiting... with no watch. Having no idea what time it is. Just knowing that time is passing slowly."
12,35,Susan,I wish I had a bigger chest to carry the mud.
12,35,Rudy,"I've been muddy, but not this kind."
12,35,Kelly,"It feels good to, you know, win something. I haven't won much of anything, but I won yesterday and I won today. I'd feel better if it was an immunity that I won today, but, hopefully, I'm on a winning streak."
12,35,Sean,"Everybody was very pissy prior to the mud bath, myself included. I mean, things really changed here today. There was a fight, for the first time between Kelly and Sue, but, truthfully, this-this little shenanigan game at the mud bath thing, uh, really paid off, I think. And it did-- it rejuvenated us. And I think it rekindled, you know, just, like, friendships and laughing, and things like that."
12,35,Susan,"(laughs) Yeah, the mud game was a blast. I had a blast. Fun-- totally a lot of fun."
12,35,Kelly,"When we got back from the mud, we were washing, you know, helping each other get the mud off and things like that."
12,35,Richard,"It's bizarre to me how people do the things they do-- like how Sue and Kelly are washing each other's back and hair and, you know, laughing, and joking and hugging, and picking each other's zits and all the rest of it right now, after what they went through yesterday."
12,35,Susan,"Doing the mud thing really wore a lot of energy out of us, so it did key us down quite a bit. And, uh, Kelly's the only other girl on the island with me, so we're going to hang together to the end."
12,36,Kelly,"There is four days left, and we're all still going to have to live together. And Sue and I, we kind of patched things up and, you know, she said, ""Hey, look, this is a game. ""I'm going to have an alliance with Rich instead of you."" And I said, ""Fine, you know. That's cool. Play the game."""
12,36,Kelly,"I said, ""I think I deserve to get to the Four and I think I deserve to get to the Three."" She said, ""Well I'm not going to let you."" And it's the other way around-- I'm not going to let her."
12,36,Susan,We'll keep to an agreement that we'll treat each other civil till the time we leave here. No sense to make it hard on anybody.
12,36,Richard,"Check that out. Look at the road the ant highway, up on the, uh, ceiling of the, uh, hut here. The canvas. Two-lane highway. You can see the ants going in and out. Got a really great view from here."
12,36,Sean,"All I'm thinking now is ""win."" Do what I have to do. (24:58 → 25:07 = 9s) I'm going to have to win immunity and I'll have to finagle. And I'm going to have to try to pick up the vibe on people. If, uh, you know, like right now, Sue and Kelly aren't getting along. There might be something I can exploit to my advantage. I might have to do stuff like that."
12,36,Susan,"Yeah, I have one more challenge. There's no rewards, and you know what? I'm not even thinking I'm going to win anymore. But I want to win the last one, like, oh, man, if I win any-- I'm praying, I'm praying that I win the very last immunity-- if I'm here, if I make it through the next four, which I think I will."
12,36,Sean,"I'm winning this thing. You know, it's going to be an uphill battle for me, but I'm winning this thing-- the whole show."
12,36,Rudy,"Myself and, uh, Rich are going right to the end. You know, we hope that it will be us two in the end where the jury picks one of us."
12,36,Richard,"The balance of power I don't believe has shifted from me to Kelly, but certainly I've lost some footing. Kelly wins immunity, and all kinds of things have to change and shift quickly. So it's not as easy to remain a solid alliance in the midst of a lot of flux with so few people."
12,36,Kelly,"Rich has said-- since he knows that Sue was plotting an alliance against him-- he has had to rearrange his strategy. So, um, maybe they're not voting together. I don't know. To me, that just means game on."
12,36,Sean,"I think I've always looked at it, the next Tribal Council, there'll be, you know, a lot of votes cast in different directions that were never previously cast before. I think the peop... three people that are likely to vote for Sue are me, Richard and potentially Rudy. Rudy's kind of swinging. Rudy wants to... wanted me whacked about three weeks ago, so, you know... he's a good guy. We sleep together, but he's ready to slit my throat in this contest any minute now."
12,36,Kelly,"I'm going to vote for either Rich or Sue. Um... it's time to get dirty. No more Mr. Nice Guy. I... as I said, I don't know. It's every man for himself."
13,37,Richard,"Time is kind of out of my head. I don't have a clock or a calendar or a watch or anything, but for some reason, I feel really, really comfortable, really good now. I, um, I think it has to do with just how short... how-how little time is left."
13,37,Susan,"We're down to 60 hours. So, 60 hours, if you look at it that way, I can deal with it for a chance to win a million dollars, but the hardest thing for me here now has come down to probably the boredom."
13,37,Rudy,"The girls got, uh, razor blades in their care package, so after they got done under their arms they shaved my face."
13,37,Rudy,"We made about, uh... 200 pots of rice since we've been here. Sometimes we ate three times a day, sometimes twice a day, sometimes once a day. I'd say I lost 22 pounds since I've been here."
13,37,Richard,"I'm a wreck. My hair is way longer than I ever keep it. This feels like a mop. There's nothing left. I used to have a muscle here growing. I think I've lost a good 30 pounds since getting here, but everything's loose. There's nothing that's firm on this body anymore. Basically, I'm a physical wreck."
13,37,Kelly,"I'm completely covered in bug bites, uh, from head to toe. I've lost some weight. I've lost some muscle. I've lost quite a hunk of sanity. (chuckles) Gosh, I don't think I thought this was going to be as-as mental as it... as it ended up being."
13,37,Susan,"What's it like living with somebody you don't care for at the time... sleeping next to your enemy? You just do it. You just hang out with them and eat next to them, and just treat them like a civil person. That's all you can do."
13,37,Rudy,"Of the four of us that are here right now we formed this alliance way in the beginning, and, uh... you know, we were in a position of power where we could get rid of anybody we wanted to-- we had 'em lined up-- but now we're finished with the alliance 'cause the four of us are left, so you're on your own."
13,37,Richard,"I was really shocked in the beginning by how few people were planning. It seemed a vacation to-to sixteen people who were told what this was about, who-who saw the logo that said ""Outwit, Outplay, Outlast,"" same as I did."
13,37,Rudy,"In the beginning, nobody wanted the money, but now it's all money. You know, it's on everybody's mind. And in order to win the money you got to make an alliance or-or don't even show up."
13,37,Richard,"When we got to the point where the original four were still here as the final four, that alliance had gone through a number of machinations that changed it from being the original four to almost anybody's game."
13,37,Kelly,"I feel like I agreed to be in an alliance, and then I didn't want to be in it anymore, but I was too chicken to tell 'em that. And I tried to play both sides; I tried to vote how I wanted to vote do what I thought was right, but not let them in on it, because, hell, I want to stay in the game."
13,37,Susan,"After Gretchen, she didn't vote in any of the way the alliance voted. She was setting herself up so that if she is the last two at the end she's going to make herself look really good, 'cause we knew there would be more Pagong on the jury than Tagi."
13,37,Kelly,I just bit off way more than I could chew and it just... it all exploded.
13,37,Susan,"Yeah, what it is is greedy. She thinks she got... like, five or six people ago, it's like, you could see her turn a little bit. Then I was really irritated. This has not been easy, you know, come out here on the island and get bit up by bugs and stung by stingrays. So I told Kelly my family's my number-one goal. I think I got a better chance of winning the million dollars with arrogant Rich by my side than with her at my side."
13,37,Richard,"Had Sue not informed me that she had broken the alliance and established one with Kelly, I never would have known it and the two of them would have easily undermined me, and I could have gone at any point if they'd maintained that alliance. So it's kind of neat, cute, nice, that the final four were the initial four, but it wasn't a continuous line of ""Ooh, initial four make it all the way through."" So there's a different feeling attached to it, not that, uh, sense of accomplishment I would've had had the trust been unbreached and we went through cleanly."
13,37,Rudy,"Somebody will go tonight and we're waiting till after we get back to eat so we got more food, 'cause one mouth will be gone. Could be mine; could be anybody's. I think maybe this challenge will be they'll ask questions about each person-- maybe how old they were, what they do for a living-- which I don't know and I don't care. (chuckles)"
13,37,Kelly,"I think it's going to be questions about, um, these people-- seeing how well we knew them, how well we listened to them. I guess things like that."
13,37,Susan,"It's cutthroat time. I would say that Rich, Rudy and I are getting along well, and, uh, Kelly's the one we've been wanting to get out of here."
13,37,Kelly,"I feel completely vulnerable. I feel the odd man out. It's really stressful and it's kind of scary because, you know, I'm not ""safe"" anymore."
13,37,Rudy,Kelly would have been gone by now if she didn't ace the last two immunities.
13,37,Susan,We're praying that one of us three wins today so we can boot her out.
13,37,Kelly,"The one person I did, um, actually care about was Sue and she doesn't give two (expletive censor) about me, so I don't give a crap about anybody on this island anymore. Um, I'm here for me and everybody else can kiss my ass. (chuckles)"
13,38,Kelly,"I knew a 100% the only way that I was going to get to Day 38 and now tomorrow, Day 39, was with this little thing around my neck."
13,38,Richard,The last Immunity Challenge was standing there attached to a... an idol. I thought... “Ugh... no chance in hell of me doing that given who I was up against.” I felt I was forcing the game to go on unnecessarily.
13,38,Kelly,"So Rich just gave a little speech and said ""I hope you appreciate what I'm doing for the both of you,"" and let go, which I thought was kind of funny, like... he was tired, his arm hurt, he wanted to let go and he was trying to make some big noble sacrifice for me and Rudy-- yeah, whatever."
13,38,Richard,Cause even if I'm voted off tonight I think it's the best decision I could have made.
13,38,Kelly,"You know, it's out of my hands. So when I won today it was just like, ""Okay, that's it, chill out, relax, breathe... sleep, whatever you got to do."" Um... so it was just unbelievable. Overwhelming sense of relaxation and, uh, relief."
13,38,Rudy,"Dumb. It was a dumb move on my part. I gave away a million bucks. I would have won a million bucks if, uh, if I, uh, stayed there, didn't let go of it. It ain't nobody's fault but mine."
13,38,Kelly,I'm nervous. I'm not nervous about the vote tonight. I'm-I'm extremely nervous about tomorrow. I'm nervous about if and what I'm going to say tomorrow and what impact and effect that's going to have on the jury.
13,38,Richard,"I'm hoping that there is little likelihood of my being voted off, but I'm not all that confident. I'm not really sure. I think it's in Kelly's best interest to keep me here, but I don't know that she'll do that. I'm hoping she will."
13,38,Rudy,"Well, I think me and Kelly would fare better... I know some people that would vote for me. I don't know of hardly any that are going to vote for Rich. He stepped on some toes, and people ain't going to forgive him."
13,39,Kelly,"Woke up and it was very weird. Richard said to me, ""Okay, you're not dreaming. It's the last day and it's really just us two."""
13,39,Kelly,"This is just where I like to be. This is where I prefer to stretch and chill out and do my thing. My last little yoga session here on the beach. It's something that I've done pretty much everyday since I've been here. It helps me to relax and to quiet my thoughts. I've had a lot of moral issues. I regret being part of the alliance. That didn't make me feel so good. I regret... trusting Sue, being vulnerable to her. That really hurt me in a lot of ways."
13,39,Richard,"It's kind of nice to be one of the last two, and it's nice to have Kelly as the other member. I think I'm, uh, reflecting a little bit on-on what's happened for the 39 Days. I think I'm also thinking a little bit about questions that will be asked by the jury tonight, and how to approach some potential questions. It's an interesting morning, and I intend to stay completely out of the sun and try and do nothing."
13,39,Kelly,"But it's been really hard, mentally. Just... people trying to... My brain is just... I can't think about anything, really, right now."
13,39,Kelly,"There's been some... moral low points for me in playing this game. I've had some, kind of, not-so-proud moments, and, uh, that's things that I'm leaving here on this island, and with this game, and, uh, that don't belong in, uh... my life."
13,39,Richard,"I think it might have been cathartic for Kelly to pack things up, organize, and burn some of the stuff we just don't need anymore."
13,39,Kelly,"I'm really grateful I'm here. Um... I feel lucky to be in the... the final two. I'm nervous about the decision tonight because Rich never pretended that he wasn't in it to win, and, uh, he never pretended that he wasn't, um... scheming and conniving, and all of that, from the beginning. He's playing the game and he's never acted like he wasn't. So I-I do respect that."
13,39,Richard,"If I get second place I will not be sad. I will be happy that I've earned a hundred grand, and had a great time here, and played a game that I'm proud of, the way I played it, but I want the million. (laughs) I really want the million. Oh, my God, it would change my life."
